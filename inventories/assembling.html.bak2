				ASSEMBLING PRESS BOOKS AVAILABLE THROUGH <a href="http://www.richardkostelanetz.com/invent/archae.html">ARCHAE EDITIONS</a> AND SOUND &amp; LANGUAGE DISTRIBUTION
			</h2>

			<p><span class="title">ARCHAE EDITIONS</span>, known already for distributing	Richard Kostelanetz books that are otherwise unavailable, has taken
				over the inventory of Assembling Press publications with which he was involved. Between 1970 and 1982, Assembling Press published
				thirteen world-famous annuals of &#8220;otherwise unpublishable&#8221; (aka avant-garde) art and literature, <span class="title">Assemblings</span>.
				Instead of selecting from submissions presented to it, Richard Kostelanetz (and, at various times, Henry James Korn, Mike Metz,
				Scott Helmes, and David Cole) invited potential contributors to submit a thousand copies of whatever they wanted to include, and
				these feasty festivals of visual and verbal waywardness were alphabetically assembled into 8 1/2&#8243; by 11&#8243; books. Evaluating these
				alternate activities, the American poet and critic Karl Young wrote in the critical magazine <span class="title">Margins</span>, &#8220;In 1917 Ezra
				Pound hoped to edit magazines as whole entities--having the kind of completeness, formal integrity, structure and continuity you find in
				a good novel. Since [Pound&#8217;s] <span class="title">The Exile</span> we have had--as far as I know--only one gut innovation in magazine editing	technique. That came in 1970 with the founding of <span class="title">Assembling</span>.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Assembling Press has also issued books of poetry, fiction and
				criticism and other related experimental works in several media.
				These publications have been reviewed, exhibited and distributed
				around the work. In October, 1978, all of Assembling Press&#8217;s works
				were displayed at the the Pratt Graphics Center in New York City; it
				was, as far as anyone can tell, the first time since the <span class="title">Dial</span>
				that a small American literary press was honored with an
				institutional retrospective.
