          Though all are based upon texts, none are simple reproductions of live readings; indeed, none can be performed live as they are heard here.

        <p>
          <strong>Invocations</strong> (1981) incorporates
          prayers spoken by over four dozen ministers, in over
          two dozen languages, into duets, quintets, choruses and
          successive solos that are ultimately about the sound of
          the language of prayer. Recorded in West Berlin, this
          was mixed at the Electronic Music Studio of Stockholm
          and subsequently acknowledged in Thomas B.
          Holmes&rsquo;s <em>EleThough all are based upon texts,

          and Experimental Music</em> (1985), among other books.
          There are six versions that are identical for 58&rsquo;
          but have different openings that are roughly 3&rsquo;
          long: 1) Hebrew-Assyriac; 2) English; 3)
          Swedish-Danish-English; 4) Latin; 5) German; 6)
          Mediterranean languages. The first is available on
          Folkways (FRS 37092).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Americas&rsquo; Game: Baseball</strong> (1988)
          is an extended composition of and about sounds unique
          to the most popular game in North and Central America,
          in two parts, 29:40 &amp; 29:55.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>New York City</strong> (1983-84) is three
          compositions of and about sounds particular to my
          hometown, initially commissioned by Westdeutscher
          Rundfunk for a series of programs about the
          world&rsquo;s great metropolises, which can be played
          with thousands of slides of images likewise unique to
          New York, in either a concert or continuous
          installation&mdash;one 60&rsquo; for international
          broadcast, another 87&rsquo;, and a third version
          140&rsquo; for American audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Gospels</strong> (1982) is a continuous
          fugue of the opening four books of the New Testament
          here, since they tell the same story, heard
          simultaneously--an exhausting piece that, in my
          considered opinion, is nonetheless filled with luminous
          passages, 120&rsquo;. <strong>Die Evangelien</strong>
          (1982) is the same, but in German and considerably
          abridged, 60&rsquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Excelsior</strong> (1975) swiftly portrays a
          seduction in single-word paragraphs, spoken in stereo
          by two voices, which sound as though they may be the
          same voice, 1:20.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Plateaux</strong> (1975) has a solo voice
          reciting a text about a love affair to the background
          of a steadily declining synthesizer. 2:50
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Milestones in a Life</strong> (1976) tells,
          amidst changing reverberation, of 77 years of a
          bourgeois life in terms of the single most important
          event (milestone) to happen in each year, 3:55
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>This Is My Poem</strong> (1977) is a series in
          which that root phrase is subjected to several kinds of
          tape-delay, each of which accents different parts of
          the phrase. They too can be broadcast individually, in
          immediate succession, or between others works, :55,
          :54, :42, 2:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Declaration of Independence</strong> (1975) is
          based upon a text written for the American
          bicentennial, in which the familiar words of the
          historic American document are read backwards word by
          word, in this case by a chorus of male voices, each one
          trying to be in unison with the others, but ultimately
          failing. One version of this work, perhaps more
          suitable for popular radio broadcast, incorporates into
          the course of the piece three sets of explanatory
          voice-over remarks, 10:01.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Foreshortenings</strong> (1976) has 84
          sentences that are rearranged in several systematic
          ways to suggest alternative stories. Here they are read
          in one version by the author in dialogues with a
          quartet of himself (26:00) and in another version by
          the author in a duet with John Morgan (23:00).
          Incidentally, Charles Dodge has incorporated a portion
          of this text into a piece of computer speech synthesis
          entitled <em>He Met Her in the Park</em> in English and
          <em>Han Motte Henne I Parken</em> in Swedish. The first
          is 25:00; the second, 17:00. Both are available from
          him at Holland Hill Rd., Putney, VT 05346,
          802-387-4610.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Seductions</strong> (1981) contains sixteen
          seduction stories told by sixteen different
          amplifications of the same voice and interwoven one
          sentence at a time into a continuous, albeit spatial
          narrative, 24:46.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Relationships</strong> (1983) is an extended
          recital of a man&rsquo;s recollections of why he slept
          with certain women, as well as his conjectures of why
          they slept with him, all elaborately processed
          electronically, and, in truth, not recommended for
          juvenile audiences, 31:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Conversations</strong> (1983) are a sequence of
          twenty-seven pieces1 various in length, in which three
          German words -- <em>Jah, Nein, Doch</em> -- are
          exchanged in various, infinitely suggestive ways. This
          was composed on a Fairlight CMI during a residency at
          PASS in New York City, :32, 1:25, :24, 1:30, :15, :57,
          :21, 1:22, 5:49, :18, :40, 1:06, 5:00, 1:46, 1:55, :27,
          1:35, 2:13, :24, 2:15, :46, :17, :42, :17, 4:29, 2:51,
          :52. Like other multi-part sets of mine, these pieces
          may be played individually, in continuous sequence, or
          interspersed between other pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Dialogues</strong> (1975) are skeletal,
          implicitly erotic conversations between two voices--one
          male, the other female--speaking only two words,
          &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo;, :35, :30, :35.
          A later version was done in German (1983), with the
          addition of a third voice (&lsquo;tdoch&rdquo; for
          sure), all processed on a Fairlight CMI (computer Music
          Instrument), :40, :30, :18, :12, :09, :07, :045, :03,
          1:00, 2:00, 3:00, :03. Individual sections of both
          versions may be played/broadcast individually, in
          immediate succession or apart from each other, say,
          between other pieces in the course of a
          concert/program.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Richard Kostelanetz Mantra</strong> (1977)
          sounds as though I am repeating the trochaic rhythms of
          my name without taking a breath, as its volume runs
          down into silence. It is the most appropriate coda to
          any concert of my work, 1:~40.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What&rsquo;s in a Name</strong> (1983)
          explores, in six movements, the trochaic rhythms of my
          name with various superhuman enhancemnets (mostly from
          a Fairlight CMI), 7:25.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Restine</strong> (1986), with me reading about
          me, with linear disintegration and variable
          disintegration, both processed by Skip Brunner, each
          37:20.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Turfs/Arenas/Pitches/Fields</strong> (1980) are
          four-word poems--one hundred in English, eleven in
          French--spoken in unison by a chorus of four, processed
          in various ways at EMS, 21;26. Grounds, etc. is a
          sequel with sets of eight related words spoken in
          unison by a chorus of eight, 10:28.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Carnival of the Animals</strong> (1988), a poem
          of animal names, produced with a sampler and
          synthesizer, read by the author in English, and in an
          acoustic German translation by Tilman Reitzle, each
          14:03. Onomatopoeia (1988), produced with similar
          equipment, in two versions, one heavily processed, the
          other not, both read by the author, each 10:42.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Drunken Boat/Le Bateau Ivre</strong>
          (1986), a binaural reading, with the French original on
          one side and English translations on the other, one by
          Jonathan Cott read by Janet Cannon (and processed by
          Skip Brunner), the other by Charles Doria, each, 5:38
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Praying to the Lord</strong> (1977, 1981) has
          two sacred texts, the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer in English
          and a comparable Hebrew prayer, which are successively
          and progressively multiplied into fugues of eight
          voices, sixty-four voices and 512 voices, 5:40.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Eight Nights of Hanukah</strong> (1983) is
          the familiar prayer for lighting the candles, here read
          by two dozen laymen of diverse ages speaking Hebrew
          with a variety of accents, in various styles, mixed
          with each other into eight separate fugues of
          successively increasing voices, 5:20.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Asdescent/Anacatabasis</strong> (1978) are
          electronically processed readings of two related pieces
          that draw upon the texts of my reworkings of sentences
          from the Biblical I Corinthians 13. Each is 23:00,
          mono, and, in truth, more difficult as a listening
          experience than most of my works.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Epiphanies</strong> (1982-92) is a large number
          of single-sentence stories that are given individual
          settings. About 238 minutes have been finished German
          translations of selected stories, with sixteen readers,
          are available in two sets of mono tapes: 26:15 &amp;
          27:00; or 9:30, 9:07, 9:25, 8:53, 8:30, !0:31.. Chinese
          translations, with six readers, both native Chinese and
          Americans, 6:00.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Kaddish</strong> (1990) is an acoustic
          representation of the Jewish diaspora in the various
          ways that the Aramaic prayer for the dead is declaimed,
          in solos, duets, quartets, and choruses, commissioned
          by Westdeutscher Rundfunk, composed on a Lexicon Opus,
          with Opher Finkelthal, engineered by Frank Cunningham,
          23:22
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>No, I&rsquo;m Richard Kostelanetz</strong>
          (1973), in which various voices of myself debate
          acoustic authority, a comic masterwork produced with
          Marilyn Ries, 7:06.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ululation: Acoustic Fiction # 1</strong>
          (1992), an erotic story told exclusively in sound, with
          a spoken preface by the author, engineered by Andrew
          Benker under a grand from NEA-Media Arts, 25:56.
        </p>
