Balanchine once said the perfect type plot for a dramatic narrative ballet was the story of the Prodigal Son. Once there was a man who had everything, then he had nothing; finally he had everything again.--Lincoln Kirstein, Ballet Alphabet (1939) </p>   </card>   <card title="Epigraphs" id="card3">      <p align="center">Our action on behaviour, linked with other desirable aspects of a revolution in mores, can be briefly defined as the invention of games of an essentially new type.

The term may also apply to a play which was intended to be performed but hardly ever is, and yet has survived as a piece of worthwhile literature.--J. A.
