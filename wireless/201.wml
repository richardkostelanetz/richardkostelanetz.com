Asked by the current monarch if his predecessor might be hiding in Another Country, the chief of the secret police identifies the draft deserter, falsely reasoning that any laboring man who successfully woos such a beautiful woman must indeed be a king-in-disguise. The deserter is arrested, in a flurry of publicity, while his sometime friend, the former king, slips away. </p>   </card>   <card title="2" id="card2">      <p align="center">The head of a pirate band disrupts an island wedding and forces the Count's daughter to abandon her fiancé for him. As this new betrothal is celebrated, the pirate leader places a ring on a small statue of his former wife and is surprised to see her stone fingers close over the ring possessively. Resisting all pleas to cancel the ceremony, the pirate reveals that he is really the Count's brother and thus likewise of royal lineage. The sometime pirate arrests the Count and orders the statue of his wife to be thrown into the sea, while the daughter seeks sanctuary in a church sooner than marry her long-lost uncle. Attempting to drag the daughter away from the church, the pirate is instead dragged beneath the waves by the indomitable statue that still holds the ring. The marriage originally planned is consummated. </p>   </card>   <card title="3" id="card3">      <p align="center">A favorite concubine of the dictator pities two imprisoned deserters and secretly provides them with sufficient money to bribe their guards.

The Captain teases the soldier with accusations of his girlfriend's infidelity. The soldier finds her kissing the musician and accuses her. When the musician boasts of his success, the soldier beats him. Though his girlfriend is reading the Bible, the soldier stabs her by a pond, into which he throws his murder weapon.

cultural history. This is his first collection of ballets. He also edited Breakthrough Fictioneers (1973), Essaying Essays (1975), Scenarios (1980), Text-Sound Texts (1980), and Imaginary Dance (forthcoming) among other pioneering anthologies. His audio compositions and videotapes have been aired and exhibited around the world. In high school, he ran track; in college he read books; as an adult, he swims as often and as long as possible.
