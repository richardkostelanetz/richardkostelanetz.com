The     introduction would identify characteristics of â€œThe American Imaginationâ€     that makes American art generally different from European. The secondary theme     is that these individuals constitute the American canon and that knowledge     of their achievements is essential literacy.</p>  <p> The entries would be generally appreciative and at once introductory and     scholarly, as Iâ€™ve done before, concluding with short bibliography of both     primary and secondary references. While this reference book is destined ultimately     for libraries, I hope that the writing would be clean enough for it to life     as well as a trade book, perhaps with a book club or as a paperback reprint.     Since I did my graduate work in American history on artists in America, I     have thought about these individuals for over three decades. I expect that     the writing could come easily and deliver the book within a year of the receipt     of the advance. While many of these individuals were also covered in my <em>Dictionary     of the Avant-Gardes</em> (1992; rev. ed., 2000), I would expect to draft even     those entries from scratch, emphasizing not their avant-garde quality, as     done before, but their importance to American cultural history. Since I assume     that categories such as painting and dance define work, rather than people,     individuals will be treated in alphabetically or chronologically (by birth     year, to suggest intellectual history). The book will also have timelines     as well as sidebars on themes, institutions, and collective operations (such     as movements, schools, corporate entities).</p>  <p> Among the artists deserving individual entries, consider the following:</p>  <p>Henry Adams<br />    Edward Albee<br />    Louisa May Alcott<br />    Louis Armstrong<br />    John J.

Leon Bismarck B.). The son of Iowa German immigrants who were amateur     musicians, he began to play music as a small child and developed an interest     in ragtime and jazz that were beginning to receive national dissemination     through records and radio, not to mention traveling musicians. Playing his     cornet (a kind of trumpet) in improvising bands (The Wolverines, The Original     Dixieland Jazz Band), Beiderbecke gravitated to New York where, collaborating     with saxophonist Frankie Trumbauer, he created the epitome of white jazz--a     happy improvisatory music utterly lacking in â€œsoulâ€ but still musically impressive,     if not contageous. At his most innovative, Beiderbecke pioneered individuality     in ensemble playing and mixed classical influences with improvisation, establishing     a â€œthird streamâ€ long before that epithet was coined. Every year on his birthday,     a university radio station in New York plays Beiderbecke around the clock,     annually recovering a kind of music that got lost. if not buried, in Americaâ€™s     music competitive marketplace. As one older black musician explained during     one of those progams, the horn style represented by Louis Armstrong â€œdefeatedâ€     Beiderbeckeâ€™s, partly because the latter died young from alcohol-induced pheumonia.</p>  <p> So powerful was this image of the jazzmanâ€™s short self-destructive life     in the decade following his death that novels based on it appeared. most notably     Dorothy Bakerâ€™s <em>Young Man with a Horn</em> (1938). Nearly all of the eleven     hours that he recorded are still available on discs. The composer Richard     Sudhalter, who co-authored a biography of Bix, recently published a thick     book, <em>Lost Chords</em> (1998), obviously featuring Bix, about forgotten     American jazz produced by white people.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>CAGE, John (5 September 1912, Los Angeles - 12 August 1992, N.Y., NY). He     was one of the few American artists of whom it can be said, without dispute,     that had he not existed, the development of more than one art would have been     different. A true polyartist, Cage produced distinguished work in music, theater,     literature, and visual art. As a de facto esthetician, he had a discernible     influence upon the creation of music, several areas of performance, the visual     arts, and, to a lesser extent, literature and social thought. His principal     theme, applicable to all arts, was the denial of false authority by expanding     the range of acceptable and thus employable materials, beginning with non     pitched &quot;noises,&quot; which he thought should be heard as music &quot;whether     we're in or out of the concert hall.&quot;<br />    Though long considered an avatar of &quot;chance,&quot; Cage was actually     an extremely fecund inventor who, once he disregarded previous conventions,     was able to realize a wealth of indubitably original constraints. The first     (and for long the most notorious) was prepared piano,&quot; which prevented     the emergence of familiar keyboard sounds, beginning a career that included     scrupulously alternative kinds of musical scoring, idiosyncratically structured     theatrical events, and unique literary forms. Perhaps because Cage never doubled     back, never dismissing his earlier works as wrong, his art remained â€œfar-out,â€     challenging, and generally unacceptable to the end. In the last months of     his life, he completed a ninety minute film whose visual content was a white     screen violated by various shades and shapes of gray.</p>  <p> He became such an American icon that many forget that in the middle of his     career, in the 1950s and 1960s, when I first began following Cage's activities,     no one, but no one, received so many persistently negative comments, not just     in print but in collegial conversations. Even as late as 1988 1989, when Cage     was invited to give the Charles Eliot Norton lectures at Harvard, perhaps     the most prestigious appointment of its kind, he delivered statements so barely     connected that few professors returned after Cage's initial lecture!</p>  <p> Politically an anarchist from his professional beginnings, he worked, as     much through example as assertion, to eliminate authority and hierarchy, even     in his life, never accepting a position that might give him cultural power     (as distinct from influence), never composing any work that requires an authoritarian     conductor or even a lead instrumentalist who stands before a backup group.     When Cage accepted the Norton position that gave him a title elevating him     above the rest of us humans, I asked him what it was like being a Harvard     professor. &quot;Not much different from not being a Harvard professor,&quot;     he replied, true to his politics.</p>  <p> Not unlike other avant garde artists, Cage made works, in his case in various     media, that are much more or much less than art used to be. Though the Minimal     pieces should not be slighted, the greatest Cage works, in my considered opinion,     are his Maximal compositions: <em>Sonatas and Interludes for Prepared Piano</em>     (19461948) is his longest and most exhaustive exploration of his first musical     invention. <em>Williams Mix</em> (1953) is a tape collage composed of thousands     of bits, intricately fused onto six tapes that should be played simultaneously,     so that the result is an abundance of sounds within only several minutes.     In <em>HPSCHD</em> (1969), Cage filled a 15,000 seat basketball arena with     a multitude of sounds and sights, and Europera (1987) draws upon 19th century     European opera for musical parts, costumes, and scenarios that are then distributed     at random to performers in a professional opera company. Given my bias toward     abundance, my favorite Cage visual art is the sequence of Plexiglas plates     that became <em>Not Wanting to Say Anything About Marcel</em> (1969); my favorite     Cage text, the Harvard lectures that became the long poem I VI (1990).</p>  <p> In his notorious â€œsilent piece,â€ the superficially much, much less <em>4â€™33&quot;</em>     (1952), he became an avatar of conceptual art. By having the distinguished     pianist David Tudor make no sound in a concert otherwise devoted to contemporary     piano music, Cage framed four minutes and thirty three seconds of a pianist's     inactivity to suggest that the inadvertent sounds within the auditorium constitute     the &quot;musical&quot; experience and, by extension, that all sounds, whether     intentional or not, can be considered music. (One strain of conceptual art     consists of demonstrations or statements that convey radical esthetic implications.)     Since the content of <em>4â€™33â€</em> and its successors is miscellaneous sounds,     it is more accurate to characterize it as a <em>noise piece</em>. With a single     resonant gesture, he extended a tradition of American classical music, pioneered     by Henry Cowell and Edgar Varese, of exploring sound that is not just atonal     but chaotic.</p>  <p> Cage also revolutionized musical scoring (eventually collecting an anthology     of <em>Notations</em> [1969] that mostly reflects his influence), introducing     graphic notations and prose instructions in place of horizontal musical staves.     By book-art criteria, the most extraordinary of his own scores is the twovolume     <em>Song Books (Solos for Voice, 3-92)</em> (1970), which contains, in part     through length and number, an incomparable wealth of alternative performance     instructions. He also ranks among the rare artists whose statements about     his own work were often more true and insightful than his critics' writings.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>CUNNINGHAM, Merce (16 April 1919, Centralia, WA). After years off the edge     of American dance, Cunningham became, beginning in the late 1960s, the principal     figure in advanced American choreography, remaining into the 1990s the most     influential individual, as much by example as by becoming a monument whose     activity still intimidates his successors. Born tight-jointed, he could leap     but could not extend or contort. Taller than most dancers and more solidly     built as well, he was always a commanding dancer.</p>  <p> Originally part of Martha Graham's dance company, he presented in 1944,     in collaboration with John Cage, his first New York recital of self composed     solos. Rejected by dance aficionados who were devoted to prior masters, Cunningham     earned his initial following among professionals in other arts.</p>  <p> The initial reason for the dance world's neglect was that Cunningham had     drastically reworked many dimensions of dance making: not only the articulation     of performance time, but the use of theatrical space; not only the movements     of dancers' bodies, but their relationship to one another on the stage. For     instance, if most ballet and even modern dance had a front and a back, Cunningham's     works are designed to be seen from all sides; and though theatrical custom     has forced him to mount most of his performances on a proscenium stage (one     that has a front and thus a back), his pieces have also been successfully     performed in gymnasiums and museums.</p>  <p> Time in Cunningham's work is nonclimactic, which means that a piece begins     not with a fanfare but a movement, and it ends not with a flourish but simply     when the performers stop. Because he eschews the traditional structure of     theme and variation, the dominant events within a work seem to proceed at     an irregular, unpredictable pace; their temporal form is, metaphorically,     lumpy. &quot;It's human time,&quot; he explains, &quot;which can't be too     slow or too fast, but includes various time possibilities. I like to change     tempos.&quot;</p>  <p> His dances generally lack a specific subject or story, even though interpretation     hungry spectators sometimes identify particular subjects and/or semblances     of narrative (and more than one Cunningham dancer has suspected the existence     of secret stories). It follows that his dancers eschew dramatic characterizations     for nonparticularized roles, which is to say that Cunningham dancers always     play themselves and no one else. Just as he defied tradition by allowing parts     of a dancer's body to function disjunctively and nonsynchronously, so the     distribution of his performers customarily lacks a center--important events     occur all over the performing area, even in the corners. The result is organized     disorganization, so to speak, that initially seems chaotic only if strict     forms of ordering are expected.</p>  <p> The titles of Cunninghamâ€™s works tend to be abstract (<em>Aeon</em> [1961],     <em>Winterbranch</em> [1964]), or situational (<em>RainForest</em> [1968],     <em>Summerspace</em> [1958], <em>Place</em> [1966]), or formally descriptive     (<em>Story</em> [1963], <em>Scramble</em> [1967], <em>Walkaround Time</em>     [1968]). As his dancers' gestures have been ends in themselves, rather than     vehicles of emotional representation or narrative progression, Cunningham     freed himself to explore the possibilities of human movement. In this respect,     he has been incomparably inventive and remarkably prolific. To put it differently,     once he decided that the old rules need not be followed, he was free to produce     many dances filled with unfamiliar moves and innovative choreographic relationships.</p>  <p> Because Cunningham's activities are not symbolic of human activities or     emotions, they are meant to be appreciated as ends in themselves. His dance     thus demands not empathy from the spectator but, as Cage once explained, &quot;your     faculty of kinesthetic sympathy. It is this faculty we employ when, seeing     the flight of birds, we ourselves, by identification, fly up, glide and soar.&quot;     What seems at first inscrutable about Cunningham's choreography is quite comprehensible,     providing one does not strive too hard to find underlying &quot;significances.&quot;     What you see is most of what there is.</p>  <p> Another departure comes with his use of music. Whereas most choreographers     draw their inspirations from particular scores, Cunningham composes all but     a few of his pieces without music; his dancers count to themselves for their     cues. What music is heard in his work is customarily composed apart from the     dance, as is the decor and costumes, and thus not mixed with the dance until     the final rehearsals. The music tends to be harshly atonal and rhythmically     irrelevant, as Cunningham has for his accompaniments long favored John Cage     and those composers gathered around him.</p>  <p> Cunningham's choreographies are generally many sided, nonlinear, nonexpressionistic,     spatially noncentered, temporally nonclimactic, and compositionally assembled.     The decor and sound are supplementary, rather than complementary; and the     dancers are highly individualized. Though his art is avant garde, his sensibility     is classical, which is to say precise, Constructivist &lt;/HC&gt;, and severe.     He reveals the enormity of his choreographic intelligence through his profound     knowledge of dance and dancers, coupled with his seemingly limitless capacity     for invention.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>STEIN, Gertrude (3 February 1874, Allegheny, PA 27 July 1946, Paris, France).     She was, simply, the Great American Person of Avant-Garde Letters in that     she produced distinguished work in poetry as well as prose, theater as well     as criticism, nearly all of it unconventional, if not decidedly avant garde.     She could not write an ordinary sentence if she tried; for though her diction     is mundane and her vocabulary nearly always accessible, her sentence structures     are not. One early development, evident in <em>Three Lives</em> (drafted around     1904), was the shifting of syntax, so that parts of a sentence appear in unusual     places. These shifts not only repudiate the conventions of syntactical causality,     but they also introduce dimensions of subtlety and accuracy. Instead of saying     &quot;someone is alive,&quot; Stein writes, &quot;Anyone can be a living one,&quot;     the present participle indicating the <em>process</em> of living.</p>  <p> It is clear that there are two Gertrude Steins in American literatureâ€™s     canon. Those who prefer <em>Three Lives</em> and the <em>Autobiography of     Alice B. Toklas</em> tend to dismiss as &quot;incomprehensible junk&quot;     an oeuvre that I find the richest experimental writing ever done by an American.     More than a half-century after her death, even generations after it was written,     much of this writing is not understood, is not taught in the universities,     and, for the most part, is not even in print. In the unabridged, 925 page     <em>The Making of Americans</em> (1926; first drafted around 1906 1908, well     before the innovative novels of James Joyce and William Faulkner, she developed     what subsequently became her most notorious device--linguistic repetition.     To be precise, she repeats certain key words or phrases within otherwise different     clauses and sentences; so that even though the repetitions are never exact,     this repeated material comes to dominate the entire paragraph or section,     often becoming the primary cohering force within an otherwise diffuse passage.     As Stein neglected subject, setting, anecdote, conflict, analysis, and many     other conventional elements, <em>style</em> became the dominant factor in     her writing, more important than &quot;theme&quot; or &quot;character.&quot;</p>  <p> Freed from conventional syntax (and the Aristotelian principles informing     it), Stein was able to explore the possibilities of not just one but several     kinds of alternative English. Having worked with accretion and explicitness,     as well as syntactical transpositions, she then experimented with ellipses     and economy; having written about experience with many more words than usual,     she tried to write with far, far fewer. In <em>Tender Buttons</em> (1914),     for instance, her aim was the creation of texts that described a thing without     mentioning it by name. Other prose pieces have as their real theme, their     major concern, kinds of coherence established within language itself: &quot;Able     there to ball bawl able to call and seat a tin a tin whip with a collar&quot;;     or, &quot;Appeal, a peal, laugh, hurry merry, good in night, rest stole.&quot;     The unifying forces in such sentences are stressed sounds, rhythms, alliterations,     rhymes, textures, and consistencies in dictionâ€”linguistic qualities other     than subject and syntax; and even when divorced from semantics, these dimensions     of prose can affect readers.</p>  <p> After experimenting with prolix paragraphs, she then made fictions out of     abbreviated notations, such as these from &quot;The King of Something&quot;     in <em>Geography and Plays</em> (1922):</p>  <p>PAGE XVI.<br />    Did you say it did.<br />    PAGE XVIII.<br />    Very likely I missed it.<br />    PAGE XIX<br />    Turn turn.</p>  <p>Not only does such compression (along with the omission of page XVII) represent     a radical revision of narrative scale, but writings like these also realize     the French Symbolist theoretical ideal of a completely autonomous languageâ€”creating     a verbal reality apart from extrinsic reality. However, whereas the Symbolists     regarded language as the top of the iceberg, revealing only part of the underlying     meaning, Stein was primarily concerned with literature's surfaces, asking     her readers to pay particular attention to words, rather than to the content     and the motives that might lie behind them. What you read is most of what     there is.</p>  <p> Her plays consist primarily of prose passages that are sometimes connected     to characters (and other times not). Only occasionally are characters identified     at the beginning of the text, while the customarily concise texts rarely include     stage directions of any kind. Stein was not adverse to having &quot;Act II&quot;     follow &quot;Act III,&quot; which had followed a previous &quot;Act II.&quot;     There is typically nothing in her theatrical scenarios about tone, pace, costumes,     decor, or any other specifics, all of which are thus necessarily left to the     interpretation of the plays' directors. Because scripts like these are simply     not conducive to conventional realistic staging, most directors have favored     highly spectacular, sensorily abundant productions that incorporate music     and dance, in sum exemplifying Stein's idea of theater as an art of sight     and sound.</p>  <p> Her essays were also unlike anything written before in that vein. In discussing     a particular subject, she avoided the conventions of exposition, such as example     and elaboration, in favor of accumulated disconnected details and miscellaneous     insights, often frustrating those readers requiring accessible enlightement.     Stein's reputation for distinguished prose has obscured her poetry, which     was likewise concerned with alternative forms, beginning with acoherence,     especially in her monumental &quot;Stanzas in Meditation,&quot; and including     the horizontal Minimalism &lt;/HC&gt; of one word lines:</p>  <p>There<br />    Why<br />    There<br />    Why<br />    There<br />    Able<br />    Idle</p>  <p>Stein frequently boasted that in writing she was &quot;telling what she knew,&quot;     but most of her knowledge concerned alternative writing. It is indicative     that the principal theme of her essays, reiterated as much by example as by     explanation, is the inventions possible to an author accepting the esthetic     autonomy of language.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>SESSIONS, Roger (28 December 1896, Brooklyn, NY - 16 March 1985, Princeton,     NJ). A brainy American composer who entered Harvard at 14, he later studied     with Horatio Parker (who also taught Charles Ives) at Yale before beginning     his own teaching career at Smith College (1917-21) and the Cleveland Institute     of Music (1921-25). Moving to Europe for several years, he composed works     reflecting the influence of Igor Stravinsky and Ernst Bloch (1880-1959), a     Swiss composer whom Sessions had assisted in Cleveland. Mostly in absentia,     he collaborated in 1928-31 with Aaron Copland, likewise Brooklyn-born, in     sponsoring in New York what came to be known as the Copland-Sessions concerts     that were very influential at the time. Frightened by Hitlerâ€™s rise, which     he saw firsthand, he returned home in 1933, teaching successively at Boston     University, Princeton, Univ. of California at Berkeley, and then Princeton     again. Retiring from there in 1965, he then taught for nearly two decades     more at Juilliard. He was among the first major American composers to realize     that he could do his own work while teaching not at a â€œconservatoryâ€ but at     a liberal-arts university. (Among his contemporares, Virgil Thomson, George     Gershwin, Elliott Carter, and Aaron Copland all avoided teaching positions,     while Howard Hanson and William Schuman ran music conservatories.)</p>  <p> A subsidiary benefit of teaching at an Ivy League university with a serious     program in music was many ambitious students who would later have their own     careers. Retiring from Princeton in 1965, he later taught at Juilliard, whose     graduate programs have always produced professionals. More than a decade after     his death. Sessions is frequently cited in younger composersâ€™ biographies,     where teachers are customarily acknowledged (as in dance, but not in painting).     Among those featured in this book Sessions is acknowledged by Conlon Nancarrow,     Milton Babbitt, James K. Randall, and Eric Salzman. In Kyle Gannâ€™s incomparably     populous survey of contemporary American composers, <em>American Music in     the Twentieth Century</em> (1997), for instance, Sessions is mentioned for     teaching David del Tredici (1937), Frederic Rzewski (1938), John Harbison     (1938), Ellen Taafe Zwilich (1939), Daniel Lentz (1941), and Tod Machover     (1953), most of whom produced music distinctly different from Sessionsâ€™ own.     Because few, if any, American arts professors, in any art, had so many distinguished     students, Sessions became the model for younger composer/professors, though,     if only because other universities are imitating Princetonâ€™s example in the     1950s and 1960s, it it doubtful if any contemporaries will have have as many     pupils who became subsequently prominent.</p>  <p> Perhaps because so much of Sessionsâ€™ time was spent teaching, the catalog     of his works emphasizes substantial works, with remarkably few minor and occasional     pieces. One theme of his music and musical career was increasing density,     as Sessions progressed from works reflecting the influence of Stravinsky in     the 1920s to 12-tone compositions in the 1950s. His three piano sonatas (1930,     1946, 1965) exemplify this development, as the third is chracterized justly     as the â€œ<em>Hammerklavier</em> of the 20th century--half as long, with twice     as many notes.â€ Perhaps because he was fortunate enough to receive commissions     to the end of his life, Sessions was especially productive in his seventies,     when in John Habrisonâ€™s phrases, â€œcontrasts [in his music became] more sudden,     transitions more swift, sections less balanced, and motivic connections less     literal.â€</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>CUMMINGS, E.E. (14 October 1894 - 3 September 1962). The avant garde Cummings     is not the author of lyrics reprinted in nearly every anthology of American     verse or of a name entirely in lowercase letters, but of several more inventive,     less familiar poems. Appreciation of this alternative Cummings should begin     with such poetic wit as &quot;Gay Pay Oo&quot; for the Soviet secret police     (G.P.U); his use of prefixes and suffixes to modify a root word in various     subtle ways (so that &quot;unalive&quot; is not synonymous with dead); his     evocative typography (as in a familiar poem about grasshoppers, or &quot;t,a,p,s,&quot;     or &quot;SpRiN,K,LiNG&quot;); and his integration of the erotic with the experimental.     He wrote poems that cohere more in terms of sound than syntax or semantics:     &quot;bingbongwhom chewchoo /laugh dingle nails personally /bin&quot; loamhome     picpac /obviously scratches tomorrowlobs.&quot; He wrote abstract poetry long     before anyone else in America, the opening poem of <em>1 X 1</em> (1944) beginning:     &quot;nonsum blob a / cold to /skylessness /sticking fire Amy are you / are     birds our all/ and one gone/ away the they.&quot; &quot;No Thanks&quot; (1935)     is an extraordinary poem beginning &quot;bright&quot; that contains only eleven     discrete words, all six letters or less in length; they are successfully broken     apart and nonsyntactically combined to form fifteen lines of forty-four wordsâ€”all     three letter words appearing thrice, all four letter words four times, etc.     With such rigorous structures Cummings presaged several major developments     in contemporary avant garde poetry. Though some of these innovations were     not included in earlier selections and collections of Cummings's poetry, thankfully     they all appear in the latest edition of his <em>Complete Poems</em> (1991),     which incidentally demonstrates that these more experimental poems were done     throughout his career, rather than, say, being bunched within a short period.     They are featured in <em>AnOther E. E. Cummings</em> (1998), which also includes     examples of his highly experimental plays, perhaps the first film scenario     written in America by a noted poet (1926), elliptical narratives, his theater     criticism that emphasizes performances over drama, and the opening chapter     of a text known only as <em>No Title</em> (1930), whose prose broaches abstraction.     Consider these concluding lines from its opening chapter:</p>  <p>while generating a heat so terrific as to evaporate the largest river of     the kingdom--which,completely disappearing in less than eleven seconds,revealed     a giltedged submarine of the UR type,containing(among other things)the entire     royal family(including the king, who still held his hat in his hand) in the     act of escaping,disguised as cheeses.</p>  <p> NOTE TO PUBLISHER: THIS WAS TRANSCRIBED ACCURATELY--DO NOT INSERT SPACES     AFTER PUNCTUATION ABOVE</p>  <p>(A reviewer of <em>AnOther E.E.C.</em> noted that it places Cummings â€œnot     among Pound and Eliot, with whom he has little in common, but rather with     Russian Futurists and Dadaists; with Latin American and German concrete poets;     [etc.]â€, all of which I wish I said before him, because his reassignment is     true.) No appreciation of the avant garde Cummings would be complete without     acknowledging his <em>Eimi</em> (1933, often out of print), a prose memoir     of his disillusioning 1931 trip to the Soviet Union, as audacious in style     as it is in content, along with the brilliant retrospective summary of this     book that he prepared for a reprint in the late 1950s. Cummings also produced     a considerable amount of visual art, which has never been fully exhibited     (even though his oeuvre reportedly includes over 2,000 paintings and over     10,000 sheets of drawings). In short, donâ€™t forget the avant-garde Cummings     behind the familiar versifier. </p></div>
