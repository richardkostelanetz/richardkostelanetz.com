"There is one final area of collecting which calls for more extended discussion. I refer to an extremely small group of authors--innovators or ground breakers, the ones whose work made such an impact that the entire course of English and American literature was altered ever after. A careful scrutiny of book prices over the past century will reveal one incontrovertible fact: that is, theirs are the works that stay in demand, whose prices continually rise, regardless of the fashions in collecting."
--Robert A. Wilson, Modern Book Collecting (1980)

RECENT RICHARD KOSTELANETZ BOOKS AVAILABLE ON AMAZON CREATESPACE WHOSE PRICES CANNOT BE BEAT.


1 – 99: A Book is an extended narrative composed only of large numerals appearing one to a recto page, implicitly revealing, as do other Kosti books, narrative with materials other than words.
Born on the same day that the prominent Dutch writers Menno Ter Braak and Edgar du Perron both died, 14 Mei 1940, Richard Kostelanetz channels pages from their strongest writings as though they were his own, so that literary Dutch, which, though he does not speak, sounds as if he could have written it.
100 Chapters is an essay on Conceptual Writing exploring the limits of narrative minimalism with large Roman numerals alone.
Each of Richard Kostelanetz’s 1001 Stories Enumerated is only a single sentence in length.
245 Film Scenarios publishes RK’s prose proposals for films that probably will never be shot, though they can be imagined. In the tradition of Conceptual Art, these texts document absence.
A Special Time reproduces with imaginative typography the testimonies of the participants in a mid-1980s acoustic symposium about the 1960s in America. 
A Universe of Sentences reproduces a Richard Kostelanetz text originally compiled during the 1980s of classic aphorisms by others, creating from these selections a universe of experience, here imaginatively designed by the author. 
Absence Captioned represents a new departure for Kostelanetz, who here writes prose texts to accompany framed images either wholly black or wholly white.
Extending Richard Kostelanetz’s monumental English-Language Writing project with additional Book Art, Ambiguities contains a wealth of short sentences that can be understood in two or more radically different ways.
Aminima represents the latest interwoven collaboration of John M. Bennett and Richard Kostelanetz. Whereas the volume titled The Sock Sack  Unfinished Fictions   More Inserts (Luna Bisonte, 2010) an had one JMB book, one RK book, and one collaboration all bound between a single set of covers, Furtherest Fictions/Backackwords (Blue Lion, 2007) has RK texts continuously on the rectors and JMN upside down continuously in the versos. The departure represented in this new Animina is publishing both their texts continuously on the same pages without their names, as JMB offers continuously one kind of writing uniquely his while RK further explores Ghosts, which is his generic term for words in which other, resonantly complimentary words can be discovered.
An Epic Poem for the 21st Century is a book-length text with sections and stanzas but written in a language new to our times.
An Episodic Novel/A Condensed Novel contains two explorations, one considerably longer and stylistically different than the other, here bound back to back, of decidedly skeletal extended narratives with only one sentence typographically large on every book page, thus, extending its author’s continuing project, in progress for nearly five decades, of defining radically alternative fictions. 
Back&Forth& has two-part texts distributed on both sides of an individual book page that must be turned both back and forth to be read.
Black Writings contains the darkest English words barely visible on a black background, all elegantly printed.
Book Publishers Remembered counters the familiar myth that “they are all alike” with Kosti’s critical portraits of the dozens with whom he has worked over five decades
Categories represents an ironic effort at classifying Richard Kostelanetz’s activities under various rubrics some of which are less familiar than others.
CF 1: A Constructivist Novella is a single extended narrative of four-sided symmetrical drawings that through metamorphosis create an abstract graphic narrative complimented by the author’s verbal commentary appearing one word at a time. 
CF 2: A Constructivist Novella has white lines on black pages, in contrast to its predecessor that has the more familiar format of black lines on white pages.
Checkmates extends Richard Kostelanetz’s long-fomenting interest in using materials other than words for fictional narratives.
Conceptual Fictions is an extended critical essay with resonant examples.
Contradictions/Enfoldings contains short statements that are intrinsically crossed.
Contemporary Proverbs gives the form a new look possible only in the 21st Century.
Cunts After John Updike explores the richness of our English language as exemplified by a wealth of imaginative synonyms for a certain familiar word that couldn’t appear in legitimate English print several decades ago.
Curious English collects what is announced in its title.
Deauthorized is Ms. Shuang Li’s production of the author Richard Kostelanetz seen in a variety of poses different from those customarily accompanying book ads and jackets/flaps.

English, Incredible English is Richard Kostelanetz’s artful alphabetical gatherings of English works unfamiliar to nearly all readers, even if they are available in dictionaries. They appear one to a book page in ten thick volumes and then in a supplement of additional words in four likewise alphabetical volumes—in sum, a monumental achievement.
Epiphanies, at a thousand pages in two volumes, represents Richard Kostelanetz’s selection from the single-sentence stories, written since 1980, that are meant to be the heightened moments in otherwise non-existent narratives. Here they appear one to a book page highly designed by Aryeh Cohen-Wade.
Epitaphs are gravestones with fictional, mostly comic inscriptions, meant to suggest minimally unique lives.
Erotic Minimal Fictions collects from stylistically avant-garde pornography that Kostelanetz has written since the late 1960s.

Kosti’s Aphorists collects three chapbooks each devoted to translations and/or rewritings of the aphorists Karl Kraus, Ambrose Bierce, and H.L. Mencken-George Jean Nathan.
Kosti’s Benny epitomizes Richard Kostelanetz’s continuing Book-Art project honoring his precursors: here an American comedian who got more laughter from saying little and sometimes nothing in strategic pauses, whose framing of weighty absence made him a precursor of contemporary Conceptual Art. Consider it a distinguished companion to Kosti’s Kostro, Kosti’s Marinetti, Kosti’s Pep Dream, Kosti’s Ambrose, Kosti’s Ramon, Kosti’s Gustave, Kosti’s Two Johns, 14 Mei 1940, and May 14, 1940 in Richard Kostelanetz’s high modernist homage.
Kosti’s Comedians incorporates four chapbooks, each appreciating a favorite American comedian in a different way: Al Kelly, Lord Buckley, Groucho Marx, and Abe Lincoln. Among the moves are reworking their classic texts, annotating favorite lines, and imitating.
Kosti’s Early Commonplace Book/The East Village 1970 reproduces the aphorisms that Richard Kostelanetz tacked to the wall of his studio between 1967 and 1974, along with his recent commentary on these monumental quotations, all in another contribution to his continuing interest in alternative autobiographies. Backing on it are eleven pages from the sequence of rich visual poems, here superimposed over a contemporary photograph that is recomposed, of the individual streets in Richard Kostelanetz’s neighborhood at the time.
Kosti’s Kostro is the first of several projected Richard Kostelanetz homages through imaginative appropriation of his most important predecessors. Much as RK has been called Kosti by his oldest friends, so Wilhelm Albert Włodzimierz Apolinary Kostrowicki, commonly known as the French poet Apollinaire, was called Kostro by his buddies. For Kosti’s Kostro Richard Kostelanetz takes his predecessor’s classic manifesto “The New Spirit and the Poets” and subjects it one paragraph at a time to two levels of translation into English—the first “automatically” through Google, the second as Kosti’s rewriting. Across from it as a continuous counterpoint appear some Kosti manifestoes reflecting the influence of Kostro’s classic essay. As an appendix, the book has Kosti’s personal translation of Kostro’s monumental poem “Zone.”
Kosti’s Marinetti reprints the Italian writer’s classic typographically enhanced essays across from Kosti’s translations into English of his prose manifestoes.

Kosti’s Poe’s Maelström “illustrates” a classic Edgar Allan Poe story with Richard Kostelanetz’s images distributed along with the historic text over 110 pages, in a contemporary redefining of the classic form of a graphically illustrated novel.
Kosti’s Queneau is Richard Kostelanetz’s homage to the French writer whose work has been so influential on many contemporary writers. In this case, Kosti takes 14 lines of his statements honoring Queneau and subjects them to 99 scrambling strategies.
Kosti’s Two Johns is Richard Kostelanetz’s homage to two of his contemporaries, surnamed Bennett and Colombo, who, since they’ve both produced a huge number of books, have their titles reproduced in a combined alphabetical order, in sum making a book unlike any other in historic literature or contemporary book art.
Kostisms, dedicated to Samuel Johnson, contains Kostelanetz’s long-fomenting definitions of common and uncommon words.
Kosty’s Pep Dream honors as it appropriates an esoteric literary text with which Richard Kostelanetz feels certain affinities.

Born on the same day that Emma Goldman died, May 14, 1940, Richard Kostelanetz channels pages from her strongest writings as though they were his own.
Meditations/Points contains on facing pages two kinds of single-word aphorisms, the first containing resonant words suggesting process, the second kind suggesting perception, all in the tradition of radically alternative exposition defined in his anthology Essaying Essays (1975, reprinted 2012).
Richard Kostelanetz’s Monoepics is a new collection of his radically Minimal Fictions, to recall a term that was vulgarized during the 1970s. With only one word and a fullstop/period to a page he tells a multitude of monumental stories. For texts like this are his fictions acknowledged in several histories and encyclopedias of modern literature.
More Portraits from Memory contains visual-verbal portraits so faint they are barely decipherable. 
Narrative Pictures/Still Lifes is two books whose pages are entwined, each with words and only words realizing the first title continuously on recto pages; only words exemplifying the latter painterly aim continuously on verso pages—in sum, to do with words alone what the visual artist does with pictures.
Null explores the ultimate negative is a great variety of languages
In a rich variant of his Constructivist Fictions, the writer/book-artist Richard Kostelanetz has hand-drawn abstract graphic fictions of visually different squares moving around the field of a page. With titles echoing Russian Constructivism/Futurism, Of 4 & 5 Squares contains two novellas; With 6 Squares, a novel.
As another example of Richard Kostelanetz’s complimenting English-Centered Writing with Book Art, One-Letter Changes makes narratives out of successions of English words that differ from their predecessors in only one word.
One-Line Plays epitomize Richard Kostelanetz’s continuing exploration of extreme minimalism in literature. Its precursor is Vocal Shorts (2012); its successor, One-Word Plays (2014), both also available on CreateSpace. All these texts are indeed meant to be performed by any numbers of speakers, in a great variety of acoustic spaces.
Page-Turners has two-page verbal texts that depend upon the reader’s turning the page from the recto to the verso (and perhaps back again) to be read.
Par Sings, initially prepared for “Ambiguities,” are based upon long English words which, when broken apart into shorter familiar words, reveal different meanings. Though some earlier Fict-ions of mine realize a similar result, none are included here.
Phobia Phobias: Fears explores comic variations on an English suffix.
Pitches/Turfs/Arenas/Fields (2012) continues Kostelanetz’s geometric poems with words in only the corners of the printed page, the wholes becoming more than the sum of its parts..

Remembering Many I’ve Met: My Life in Other People is another contribution to Richard Kostelanetz’s continuing exploration of alternative autobiography, here including private thoughts that, in an imaginatively book design, are barely decipherable.
Repeats Repeats contains richly various English words that, when repeated, assume different meanings.
Richard Kostelanetz’s Loves and Lives epitomizes Conceptual Book Art.
Running Footers is an essay in Conceptual Fiction, with only phrases at the bottom of each page framing absence(s) above.

Turning Points are fuller narratives that depend upon the traditional literary requirement of turning the page.
Two Tragedies & Two Comedies is another Kostelanetz exploration of alternative autobiography, in this book with four parts: “Dedications,” which acknowledges all the people (mostly) to whom has dedicated his individual works; “Dumpkopfbuch,” which reprints editors’ letters rejecting his submissions; “Negative Notices,” which reprints particularly severe passages from published reviews of  his work. All these texts are set on verso pages against the continuous rectos of Kostelanetz’s humongous “Résumé.” 
Unscience Fictions has single-sentence fantasies several of which run horizontally over several successive pages, each to its own length, in its own typeface.
Variations consists of a short RK autobiographical note robotically translated into over one hundred languages-in sum, incidentally documenting a universe of modern polylingual typography.
Verbal Fictions contains several departures with text alone: “Closings and Openings,” “First Truncated Novel,” “Incremental Stories,” “Longer Anagram Stories,” “ContinuousSingleSentenceStories,” “Discontinuous Stories,” and “Resurrection,” in addition an update of his Retrospective manifesto.
Versos prints on its right-hand recto pages “When boy meets girl” to lead into a rich variety of following left-hand verso pages, the whole likewise enriching the essentially bookish process of turning the page.
In Richard Kostelanetz’s Vertical Stories a pair of narratives, each with its own typeface, are run over several successive pages in continuous vertical lines, with new narratives taking the place of previous ones whose length has expired, all in Kostelanetz’s continuing contribution to the nexus of avant-garde fiction and book-art.
Visual Fictions reprints in 8½” x 11” format excepts from Kosti’s “1001 Stories” as designed by a sometime intern Nick Eve and “Openings” as designed by Mr. Eve and another intern Eun-Ha Paek, in addition to “Brush-Blush,” “Leonardo & Me,” and “All Life’s Stories End in Zero,” as designed by the author. All of these classics were previously published in literary and art magazines.
What I Didn’t Do is a radical essay in intellectual non-history that verges on Conceptual Art in documenting absence.
With 6 Squares is a single abstract grapahic narrative, perhaps a novel, dedicated to the memory of K. Melevich.
Women I’ve Known Well and Women I’ve Known Well (Notes) are two versions of a autobiography in other people, the latter more intelligible than the more expensive other.
X-Ray-K is Richard Kostelanetz’s selections of choice passages from his critical writings. In the tradition of H. L. Mencken’s Chrestomathy, this is a Kostimathy. “A reader comparing his book with mine will notice immediately that my selections are much shorter, perhaps more aphoristic.” Among the rubrics for his excerpts are Advice, Ambitions, Anarchism, Anthologies, Aphorisms, Architecture, Autobiography, Appreciations, Art Politics, Arts History, Avant-Garde, Book Art, Business, Conceptual Arts, Criticism Criticism, Cultural Criticism, Cultural History, Demolitions, Distinctions, Economics, Education, Editing, Elites & Pseudo-Elites, Elsewhere, Esthetics, Experience, Fiction, Film, Heroes, Historiography, Illustrative Anecdotes, Individuals Admired, Individuals Disparaged, Institutional Criticism, Interpersonal Intelligence, Judaism, Language, Literary Criticism, Literary Politics, Literary Sociology, Manifestoes, Music, New York City, Performance, Personal Independence, Poetry, Political Criticism, Publishing, Purposes, Radical Politics, Scholarship, Smarts, Social History, Sociology, Sociology of the Arts, SoHo, Sports, Standards, Theater Criticism, Travel, Video, and Visual Arts Criticism.

TO COME:
Austere & Cerebral Shorter Texts collects sequences too short to become a whole book, such as typographic realizations of “Excelsior” and “Milestones in a Life,” in a perfectbound volume probably to be enlarged every few years.
Boris Kostelanetz reprints texts by two men born in the same city (St. Petersburg, Russia), eighteen months apart, with the same first and last names (though a different patronymic). One immigrated to America while the other stayed home, this book implicitly examining the mysteries of naming.

Kosti’s Chronology is a witty year-by-year summary prepared by his alter ego Riccardo Castellanos Khoury.
Kosti’s Divine Comedy illustrates with Kosti’s Ghost poems the chapter titles from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s English translation of Dante’s text.
