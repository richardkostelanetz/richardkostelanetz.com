These, like his other audiopieces, are     not &quot;straight readings&quot; of his texts but audio realizations produced     mostly at radio stations and in electronic music studios, 40 min., $8.00.     Individually signed &amp; lettered, $50.00.</p>  <p><strong>Openings &amp; Closings</strong> (1976), single-sentence stories     (from a 1975 book of the same title) that are either the openings of hypothetical     fictions or the closings, read by the author in inventively amplified stereo,     60 minutes, $10.00.</p>  <p><strong>Foreshortenings &amp; Other Stories</strong> (1977), which rearranges     84 sentence-modules in systematically different ways, with two completely     different readings-realizations of the text, 60 minutes, $l0.00. </p>  <p><strong>Asdescent/Anacatabasis</strong> (l978), electronically modified readings     of texts radically reworked from the KJV (and since reprinted in <em>Prose     Pieces</em> [Atticus Press, 1985], 46 minutes, monocassette, $8.00.</p>  <p><strong>Invocations</strong> (1981), an audio-art piece about the sound of     the language of prayer, 6l minutes long, in 25 languages, recorded in West     Berlin and mixed at the Electronic Music Studio of Stockholm and subsequently     broadcast over radio stations in Germany, Holland, Canada, Australia and America.     Folkways Records issued the principal version, opening with prayers in Hebrew     &amp; Syriac; now it is available as a cassette from them and as an old-style     LP from us. $10.00. The five other versions, all available from Archae Editions,     begin with openings in, respectively, German, English, Scandanavian languages,     Latin, Italian-Yugoslav languages. $l2.00 apiece; $60.00 for the complete     set of six versions. </p>  <p><strong>Seductions/Relationships</strong> (1981-83), an audiocassette of     two formally experimental erotic narratives, respectively from <em>More Short     Fictions</em> and <em>Autobiographies</em>, 25 + 31 min. $10.00.</p>  <p><strong>The Eight Nights of Hanukah/Praying to the Lord</strong> (1983, 1981),     a stereo audio cassette of two audio interpretations of traditional sacred     texts, the first initially produced for the CBC, the latter for NPR-SPDF,     $8.00.</p>  <p><strong>Two German Horspiele</strong> (1983), two sequences of very short     pieces, <em>Dialogues</em> and <em>Conversations</em> , produced on a Fairlight     CMI, 90 minute stereocassette, $10.00.</p>  <p><strong>Audio Writing</strong> (l984), an introductory, comprehensive lecture-demonstration     of his &quot;publishing&quot; with audiotape, with examples from over a dozen     works. 91 minutes, stereocassette, $12.00. [<em>Audio Art</em> (1978) is an     earlier self-retrospective. 45 minutes, stereocassette, $10.00.]</p>  <p><strong>Acoustic Fiction I: Ululation</strong> (1992), 26', which is the     first of a projected series of compositions whose narrative proceeds exclusively     in sound, backed with <em>No, I'm Richard Kostelanetz</em> (1992), which is     speed-based acoustic humor, on a 60' audiocassette, $10.00.</p>  <p><strong>Complete Audio Writing</strong> (1985), nine cassettes, including     <em>Audio Writing, Invocations</em> (with an English opening), <em>Eight Nights/Praying,     Openings &amp; Closings, Asdescent/Anacatabasis, Foreshortenings, Seductions/Relatio|ships,     Two German Horspiele, Experimental Prose</em>, $75.00.</p>  <p><strong>Americas' Game: Baseball</strong> (1988), 60' of and about the sound     of baseball as a reflection of America, stereocassette, $10.00. An audio-only     VHS tape, along with notes and a complete velobound graphic score, gathered     together in a special box, signed &amp; lettered A to Z, $100.00.</p>  <p><strong>Onomatopoeia</strong> (1988), two realizations of the sampler-assisted     reading of words whose sound reflects their meaning, 30-minute stereocassette,     $8.00.</p>  <p><strong>More Complete Audio Writing</strong> (1987), four VHS Hi-Fi cassettes.     One includes many short pieces, beginning all those mentioned above, aside     from <em>Invocations</em> and the self-retrospectives, in addition to a few     others (<em>What's in a Name, Turfs &amp; Grounds</em>, and binaural, bilingual     renditions of Rimbaud's <em>Le Bateau Ivre</em>). Two includes New York City     , <em>The Gospels</em> and <em>Die Evangelien</em>, all originally commissioned     by European radio. Three includes all six versions of <em>Invocations</em>     in sequence (see above). Four includes four hours of <em>Epiphanies</em> in     English, followed by 45 minutes in German and then several minutes in Chinese     and then Vietnamese, all prefaced by <em>Openings &amp; Closings</em>. All     pieces on these tapes were mastered from the reel to reel originals in hi-fi     VHS stereo, which reportedly has less tape noise than audiocassette and even     the best reel to reel. Each tape is six hours long. These are thus idea for     those audiophiles who have incorporated VHS into their hi-fi systems, and     as these &quot;videotapes&quot; contain only audio they may be played on European     PAL transducers as feasibly as on American NTSC. First edition. $150.00 apiece;     $500.00 for the entire set. Another set, at similar prices, comes in the superior,     but less common 14-bit digital format of PCM-VHS. If you have any questions,     don't hesitate to ask. </p></div>
