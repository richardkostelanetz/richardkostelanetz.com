I prefer to develop     an original design for such a collection, preferring, for instance, blocks     of type in different typefaces and different sizes, perhaps with different     widths, to the conventional form of a succession of horizontal lines. One     implicit ambition, which will I hope be noticed, is revolutionizing the Look     of such compilations. I see no need to identify the original sources of the     quotations, as each should stand on its own, apart from any reference.</p>  <p> I'm little interested in what I already know, and not at all interested     in what everybody knows.</p>  <p> It now seems clear that three distinct groups of people--generations, if     you will--spent most of their twenties in the sixties. The first graduated     from college before 1960, the second matriculated afterwards; and the third     consists of those between, like myself, who were probably in college at the     turning date.</p>  <p> Anyone who was at all idiosyncratic, which is to say conscious, in 1960     can remember, I'm sure, his classmates and/or teachers advising that his waywardness     would be a handicap in the &quot;outside world&quot;; yet most of these â€œnonconformistsâ€     discovered, within a few years, that the society outside was far more cordial     than the imprisonment of school. These idiosyncracies often turned keys to     unanticipated possibilities and discoveries, as well as &quot;education,&quot;     that continued well into our late twenties. Those of us who took the leap     above convention often realized plateaus beyond our wildest dreams--not only     could I write a piece of long prose, but I liked it, and it was published,     and a book quickly followed, etc.; and the speed at which yet more possibilities     were revealed, and then possessed, never ceased to amaze me.</p>  <p> What distinguishes [Twenties in the Sixties, 1979] is the comprehensiveness     of its radicalisms--not just in politics and esthetics but literary politics     too.</p>  <p> Our views of national destiny and war, bureaucracy and wealth, chastity     and education, choice and necessity, etc., were formed by this experience     of abundance, increasingly diverging from those of our scarcity-minded elders,     and this difference became the root of the much-noticed &quot;generation gap.&quot;     We assumed that jobs would always be easily available and thus, unconcerned     about our &quot;prospects,&quot; assumed courageous risks without question     or compromise. By mid-decade, most of us found the emerging anti-authoritarian     optimism more congenial than not, and identified, however vicariously, with     the unemployable hippies, the fans joyously amassed at the great rock festivals,     the protestors at Columbia and even Chicago; for it seemed that, reservations     notwithstanding,&quot;the kids&quot; represented us, both emotionally and     intellectually.</p>  <p> Much of my critical writing confronts the problem of &quot;the new&quot;     at a time when the most interesting culture continues to be avant-garde in     more ways than one, for a key theme of Twenties in the Sixties, as well as     other works of mine, is change--not only in art but thought, not just in subject     or &quot;content&quot; but form.</p>  <p> To an extent that would have been inconceivable before 1960, we chose to     sample extremes, just to see what might happen; and this riskiness was founded     less upon any self-destructiveness than an optimistic faith that whatever     we did would somehow &quot;work out.&quot; As children of prosperity, we knew     that setbacks were temporary and that even &quot;failure,&quot; if anticipated     and acknowledged, could represent &quot;success.&quot; This preference for     energy over measure partially accounts for the great shifts in popular taste--away     from slick pop music to heavy rock, away from baseball and basketball to football     and hockey, away from above-ground movies to the &quot;underground,&quot;     away from alcohol to drugs and then to amphetamines over hallucinogens, and     these increasingly popular dark pasttimes shaped in turn the emerging consciousnes     of yet younger generations.</p>  <p> It has also been clear to me that, notwithstanding the necessity of debunking,     the prime task of truly contemporary criticism is defining order in the superficial     chaos of unprecedented cultural experience.</p>  <p> Shooting film is terribly boring, especially for a writer accustomed to     controlling his own time, because you spend most of your day sitting around     and waiting for everyone else to get his thing organized. I don't ever want     to do that again.</p>  <p> It's practically impossible for a serious writer [in America] to set fixed     prices on his work, because magazines pay such varying rates. So I've hit     upon this principle: &quot;From each according to his means,&quot; which is     to say that if theperiodical can pay, I'd like as much as everyone else. If     they can't, I canusually be conned into taking nothing more than a few contributor's     copies. I estimate that most of my magazine publishing has been gratis--especially     of my creative work. Even when I get paid, the money is rarely worth the time     and effort--by standards of the U.S. minimum wage; and my anthologies have     not been profitable either. The real rewards and pleasures--and even the vanities--of     serious writing have little, if anything, to do with money.</p>  <p> I'm not really &quot;free-lance,&quot; if I can be picky, because my services     are not for hire. I rarely do anything on an editor's suggestion--even journalism--in     part because it takes more time to research an unfamiliar subject and then     think about it profoundly, but mostly because the ideas of another person     invite compromise, less of my integrity, than of my initial purposes. Almost     everything I've written--from reviews through essays and books--was done on     my own initiative.</p>  <p> As for overarching ideas, I think you'll find a recurring concern with doing     what has not been done before--as a critic and a historian, and perhaps as     a poet and fiction writer too; and this ideal would echo a predominant theme     of my critical writing. I also try not to do any job that someone else can     do better, and if I'm asked to do a writing or editing project, my first questionis     whether or not it really belongs, so to speak, to someone else. And if it     does, I'll offer it to him. I've given away all sorts of assignments, including     several I originally initiated.</p>  <p> What we call &quot;absurd literature&quot; embodies a very specific literary     convention: a series of absurd--that is, nonsensical or ridiculous--events     that suggest the ultimate absurdity, or meaninglessness, of human existence.     At the end of Ionesco's The Chairs, a particularly neat model of the convention,     a hired lecturer addresses a nonexistent audience in an indecipherable tongue.     This is the absurd surface. Since the lecturer's message is supposed to represent     the final wisdom of a ninety-five-year-old couple, the meaningless message     becomes an effective symbol for metaphysical void.</p>  <p> The double paradox is that even anti-art inevitably reveals the influence     of previous arts, as well as creates esthetic examples that shape future art.     Perhaps because the ideas informing Dada were in essence quite simple, although     original and unfamiliar to both art historians and most artists, its impact     upon functioning creative intelligences was liable to be both quicker and     more subliminal than the complex thought of, say, Wittgenstein's philosophy     or contemporary physics; thus, I suspect that the Dada spirit has probably     infiltrated all contemporary minds whose sensibility were susceptible, slipping,     for instance, into the fiction of writers only dimly aware of the original     work.</p>  <p> On second thought, however, this particular formulation of unfettered possibility     [&quot;there really exist no limits upon the kinds of fiction that can be     put between two covers&quot;] now strikes me as needlessly conservative, if     not compromised, in one crucial respect; for if limits exist not to be respected     but exceeded, why should fictions, even those created out of words, necessarily     be printed on paper of uniform size and bound between covers? And why should     a writer piously accept the convention that all his words be printed in type     of the same size and style and then laid in evenly measured and modulated     greylines? Why should a work of imagination necessarily have a discernible     beginning and an equally definite end? Why could not a narrative be framed     on a continuous sheet of paper wound, say, between two rollers printed not     perpendicularly, like the Torah, but in lines parallel to the spindles' shafts?     Could not a writer create a room rull of words cunningly chosen, expressively     designed, resonantly arranged, and artfully draped, that would evoke the coherence     of both enviromental art and literature? (Maybe such an environmental fiction     could be mass-produced or &quot;published&quot; on screens that the purchasing     &quot;reader&quot; could then circulate to his taste around his own home.)</p>  <p> Like most prolific writers, I have more outlines and drafts in my files     than I could possibly finish, and I feel an intense and steady internal pressure     toget it all down and out. Perhaps because there is so much I could write,     I simply can't afford to start and then finish anything that does not fulfill     a personal commitment and perhaps a sense of cultural necessity. My major     problem now is getting enough publishers to support the projects I want to     do most.<br />    --##--<br />  </p></div>
