Touching upon many authors and issues in a clear critical style,     his essays on these subjects have appeared in Partisan Review, Kenyon Review,     New York Times Book Review, and many other magazines here and abroad; several,     including his classic &quot;Book Art,&quot; have been widely reprinted and     anthologized. This will be the first time they appear together in a single     volume. Since Richard Kostelanetz has published many other books about contemporary     literature and art, most everyone interested in these subjects already owns     at least one title authored or edited by him. His own efforts in these media--not     only his book-art books but the annual Assembling that he co-founded and co-produced     for a decade--have been honored and exhibited around the world. This book     belongs among collections of his essays that have already appeared--on poetry,     fiction, music, visual art, performance, and film/video.</p>  <h2>Title Page</h2>  <p> Book-Art, Anthologies, And Alternative Publishing: Salvos &amp; Appreciations,     1965-1998<br />    Richard Kostelanetz <br />    Dedication: For Ruth &amp; Marvin Sackner</p>  <h2>EPIGRAPHS TO BOOK</h2>  <p> In the offices of American publishers, an author can measure his current     rating, and perhaps his future prospects, as soon as he steps out of the elevator     and presents himself at the front desk. If your stock is high, you will immediately     be recognized, your name will have been remembered. More likely than not,     you will be kept waiting no more than a few minutes before you are ushered     into the almost genial presence of your Editor. As you move through the corridors,     between the desks, you will perhaps be greeted with a wave, a nod, an upbeat     &quot;Hi, there&quot; from the Team, of which you might now feel yourself     to be an honoured, if honorary, member. I have had one or two such golden     moments and I treasure them. If things are going less well, however--if, alack,     there is any sort of Problem with your Project, then you will soon enough     be made to know it. The receptionist will have forgotten who you are, and     will ask you to spell your name a couple of times before she eventually phones     it through. The Team will be polite enough, but strained. Your Editor will     be--shall we say?--preoccupied. You will be given the feeling that you (just     like your manuscript) have suddelny become provisional, sub judice.--Ian Hamilton,     &quot;J.D. Salinger versus Random House, Inc&quot; (1988), or GRANTA # 23</p>  <p> I should like to think of myself as writing for a wide audience in all of     my imaginative work; I know that as a fact I write for a limited, scatterd,     largely accidental audience. I believe it is due to my own defects--of style     and sensibility and scope--that my audience is so limited; I have no personal     justification for complaint. On the other hand I know that most of my contemporaries     who I admire suffer from neglect through no personal defect; the lack of deep     interest and performance is the readers' not the writers'. I assume that this     condition has always prevailed; that it is due in our day partly to the money     cost of reading, party to anthology-minded teaching of literature, and partly     to plain incapacity.--R. P. Blackmur, contribution to &quot;The Situation     of American Writing&quot; (1941)</p>  <p> These books appeared meteorically outside of the normal book market. They     were financed by the authors themselves as playthings, much in the spirit     of Dadaism, partly for the purpose of demonstrating artistic independence.--Szymon     Bojko, New Graphic Design in Revolutionary Russia (1972)</p>  <h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:</h2>  <p> Some of these essay previously appeared in American Book Review, Arshile,     Art-Rite, Ballet Review, Bulletin Maximal Art, Centennial Review, Contact     II, Information Ethics, Kalejdoskop, Kenyon Review, LAICA Jounral, Leonardo,     Margins, Mota, The New York Arts Journal, The New York Times (Arts &amp; Leisure),     The New York Times Book Review, Only Paper Today, Partisan Review, The Reporter,     Scree, Small Press Review, Umbrella, Visible Language, and other magazines,     in addition to Artists' Books (ed.

And though     I'll probably continue to write about them in one form another, now is a good     time to collect my writings particularly about this subject into a single     volume.</p>  <p> One quality of my essays is that they are written in the common tongue,     Perhaps because I've worked most of my life without affiliation, I never had     any need to pretend I was anything other than one human being writing for     another.</p>  <p> One theme of these essays is that the terms must be taken seriously--both     book art and alternative publishing is honorific--and thus that people who     use the epithets, who write about the subject, must treat them as seriously     as they would anything else worthwhile. There are no excuses for indulgence     or exploitation--none. To what degree these two subjects are really one is     for readers and reviewers to discover and decide.</p>  <p> Otherwise, I'm grateful to XYZ for publishing these essays and to ABC for     shepherding them into print. </p></div>
