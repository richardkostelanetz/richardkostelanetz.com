      <h1>Ecce Kosti!</h1>

      <p>Pleased I am that you&rsquo;ve just opened my website.
      Welcome. Here is a wealth of information and examples that
      would answer all questions about who I am, what I&rsquo;ve
      done, what I&rsquo;d still like to do. Feel free to open the
      various buttons marked with underlines, and then open the
      buttons behind the buttons, so to speak. Take your time, as a
      lot of effort went into gathering and preparing the materials
      into what we hope will be the richest internet presentation
      of its literary/artistic kinds. The photograph of me near my
      new Atlantic Ocean home was taken by Brian Kennedy for the
      Village Voice.</p>

      <p>As the entry on me in Encyclopedia Britannica calls me
      &ldquo;productive in many fields,&rdquo; this opening page
      can take you down many paths. For information about me, click
      <a href="histories/index.html">HISTORIES</a>. This includes
      not only the complete Britannica appreciation but entries
      about me in other highly selective directories; a complete
      resum&#233; as well as an abridged one; some
      bibliographies; information for public appearances, etc.</p>

      <p><a href="inventories/index.html">INVENTORIES</a> has lists
      of books published by me, my audio-musical works,
      audiovideotapes, films; in addition to catalogs from
      smallpresses associated with me: Archae Editions, Future
      Press, Assembling.</p>

      <p><a href="prop/index.html">PROPOSALS</a> has individual
      descriptions of things I&rsquo;d still like to do, support
      willing: books to author and to edit, performances,
      exhibitions, media commissions, public art, as well as
      internships and institutional seminars.</p>

      <p><a href="examples/index.html">EXAMPLES</a> has previously
      unpublished books, such as Home &amp; Away, The Maturity of
      American Thought; Book-Art, Alternative Publishing;
      under-published books, such as The Grants-Fix and Unfinished
      Business; incomplete books, such as A Special Time; and
      addenda to published books, such as my SoHo: The Rise and
      Fall of an Artists&rsquo; Colony; as well as visual art by
      me, selections from my holograms, audiotapes, videotapes, and
      static visual art. Note that since these links offer images
      and sounds, rather than texts, making them appear before your
      eyes and/or ears might take longer.</p>

      <p><a href="links/index.html">LINKS</a> will connect you to
      Ecce Kosti (updated) and the websites of some favorite
      colleagues.</p>
