I refer to an extremely small group of authors--innovators   or ground breakers, the ones whose work made such an impact that the entire   course of English and American literature was altered ever after. A careful   scrutiny of book prices over the past century will reveal one incontrovertible   fact: that is, theirs are the works that stay in demand, whose prices continually   rise, regardless of the fashions in collecting."--Robert A. Wilson, Modern Book   Collecting (1980) </font> </p></body></html>
