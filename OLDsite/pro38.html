FOSTER DAMON</b>Damon (1893-1971; Harvard, Œ14), my former teacher, was the author of, among other monuments, the first full-length critical book on William Blake to appear in America (1924)A book of Damon¹s uncollected writings should begin with the following selections, none of which previously appeared in books published under Damon¹s name. From my experience of doing several one-person anthologies, I find that, once a contract is in hand, further research usually produces additional selections. Expect me to expand an appreciation of Damon that appeared in my book The New Poetries and Some Old (Univ. of Michigan, 1991). May I point out that my selections of AnOther E. E.Cummings (Liveright, 1998), is dedicated solely to Damon.ON MUSIC AND DANCE"Modern Popular Music," Harvard Musical Review, I (November 1912)"American Influence on Modern Freneh Music," The Dial, LXV (15 August 1918)"New Work of Puccini," The Dial, LXVI (11 January 1919)"Music in Colonial New England," 1939 lecture"Francis Daniel Pastorius," Poetry: A Magazine of¹ Verse, XLIV (April 1934)"Tne Harris Collection Sheet Music," Books at Brown, XIII (March 1951)"Springfield Mountain," Journal of¹ American Folklore, LI (October-Decembcr 1946)"The Negro in Early American Songsters," Bibliographical Society of America, Papers, XXVII (1934)"A History of Square-Dancing," Proceedings of¹ the American Antiquarian Society, LXI1 (April 1952)ON LITERATURE"Chaucer and Alchemy," PMLA, XXXIX (November 1925)"Shakespeare Today," 1942 lectureReview of books by and about Thomas Lovell Beadoes, Hound & Horn, II (April-June 1929)Review of The Poetical Works of Edward Taylor, New England Quarterly, XII (December 1939)"Blake and Milton," in The Divine Vision: Studies in the Poetry and Art of William Blake (Ed.
