It would   reprint a New York Times Magazine profile of the legendary orthopedic surgeon   James Nicholas, long the team physician for the New York Jets, as well as the   profile of Detlef Schrimpf, long the foremost European professional basketball   player in America, "Working/Playing a Long Way from Leverkusen." The book would   also contain an appreciation of European soccer and a critique of a patently   under-researched book about baseball in Latin America. I want to include two   essays on the esthetic and the esthetes¹ appreciation of spectator sports‹‹"Artistry   in Football," "The Opiate of the Intellectuals." <b>Sports and Sportsmen</b>   would differ from previous collections of sports writings in including the author¹s   art about sports--a widely reprinted four-page visual poem, "Football Forms";   a numerical poem documenting "Olympian Progress"; and the complete elaborate   visual-verbal score to his hour-long audio composition, Americas¹ Game (1988),   which was recently issued on a CD. The book will open with a new essay, written   especially for this volume, on why sport should be considered as much a part   of culture as, say, poetry and fiction and, by extension, why sport has become   the only popular culture to prompt the development of disciplined thinking.   The material appeared not only in the Times Magazine but in Art & Artists, Liberty,   The Humanist, The Pushcart Prize, and several anthologies of contemporary poetry.   Though Sports and Sportsmen covers familiar subjects, the approach is so unique   that the book would gain readers from the latter distinction. Publishers interested   in considering a typescript of all but the introduction are advised to contact   the author at the address at the top of this page. Thank you. </font></h6></body></html>
