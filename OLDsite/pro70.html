I have pointed out that recordings of   them reading aloud demonstrate that in America the accents of the major writers   are quite various--there is no preferred or uniform style of speaking. Such   recordings also fulfill our curiosity about familiar authors, much as literary   biographies do, and incidentally add a dimension to our experience of their   work, as we can hear how these writers wanted their works to sound, at least   to themselves. With these themes in mind, as well as a sense of my audience   as non-American, if not non-English-speaking, I compiled a collection of taped   excerpts, drawing upon sources both public and private. My proposal is that   these excerpts be distributed into five radio programs, each 30 minutes long,   each with its own sub-title. These excerpts will be prefaced with general introductions   to the individual writers and specific remarks about the excerpt, both no more   than two minutes long. These commentaries are intended to be simple (as the   examples are often difficult) and easily translated; the excerpts, all shorter   than three minutes in length, should not be translated, however, as hearing   them in their original form is the purpose of these programs. The five programs   deal respectively with l.) Ameircan poets who made their reputations prior to   1940 (Eliot, Pound, Frost, W.C. Williams, Sandburg, Lindsay, Cummings, Millay,   Langston Hughes, Stevens, Ogden Nash). 2.) American fictoners who made their   reputations prior to l940 (Hemingway, Dos Passos, Faulkner, Stein, Porter, R.P.   Warren, S.J. Perelman). 3.) Post-War poets (Roethke, Lowell, Berryman, Bishop,   Plath, Ginsberg, O'Hara, Rexroth). 4.) Post-War fictioners (Mailer, Jones, Ellison,   Styron, Heller, Baldwin, Updike, Roth, Vonnegut, Barth, Burroughs, Nabokov,   I.B. Singer [in both English and Yiddish]). 5.) Playwrights & essayists (A.   Miller, T.Williams, Eliot [as playwright], H.L. Mencken, Albee, H. Miller, Thurber,   Capote). My expectation is that these selections are sufficiently classic to   make programs that can be rebroadcast as often as the station wishes. Radio   producers interested in sponsoring the<b> Voices of American Writing</b> should   contact me at the address at the top of this page. </font> </p></body></html>
