I now realize I was taking interns   before I ever heard the word in the late seventies.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> When I wanted to produce   animated film in the mid-1970s, I approached a local professor who allowed me   to sit in his graduate animation class. The students were told that they could   work with me in making a film, whose expenses I would pay. Two of them agreed--Barton   Weiss, who later taught in Dallas and organized film festivals there, and Peter   Longauer, who built his career upon our collaboration on the film <i>Constructivist   Fictions</i> (1976). What happened is that the latter arranged for us to make   my (our) film at a New York animation studio favored by artists. Liking his   proficiency, the studio's owner hired Longauer to work on other films. A few   years later Longauer founded his own animation business. "The Big Apple Minute,"   long familiar on New York City television screens, was his; so are many logos   seen nationally on USA cable.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> The term intern originated   in medicine to define the initial hospital experience of someone who had graduated   from medical school. As I tell my interns, "You've been to medical school, where   you worked on cadavers; now here's a live body. Can you cut?" These are internships   rather than jobs because the young person has learned a competence, but not   had the opportunity to display it. I'm giving an aspiring professional the chance   to practice what he or she has learned, so that when he or she applies for a   real job, they can distinguish themselves from the applicants who have only   college transcrips and earnest references. One incidental benefit is the transmission   of professional intelligence.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Most intern-sponsors tell   me they give young people only elementary office jobs requiring the intern's   appearance for a certain number of hours per week. One has interns file papers;   another has her help screen telephone calls. Sometimes these dull office jobs   are sweetened with the possibility of meeting someone famous or powerful. My   intuition is that anyone accepting that sort of lowly institutional internship--indeed,   anyone preferring office work--is not someone for me. Young people taking a   menial job, even with an arts organization, prove only that they can do menial   work; internships with me require those with ambition. Because my art is different   (often called "avant-garde") enough to move slowly through the marketplace,   I have lots of unfinished projects--books to design, manuscripts to put into   more publishable shape, videotapes to edit, a bibliography to compile, etc.--for   a squad of committed neophytes. What I do not have, though I hear that others   do, are square holes for which I want to generate a lot of square applicants   so that the competitive individual who is chosen can think he or she is exceptionally   fortunate to be doing nothing important. (I remember from college that whenever   a class had a limited enrollment you knew that the teacher might otherwise have   trouble filling it.)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Two basic rules for me   are 1) interns work on projects that have no immediate customers, and 2) they   do as much as possible on their own. I do not run an office, in part because   I live in my studio and have enough work of my own to do; I do not need young   people as receptionists or decoration. Those sometimes working here are using   machines, such as an audio-editing deck, that cannot be transported elsewhere.   What I do in interviewing an applicant is try to figure out what he or she can   do, given his or her interests and training. I don't want to assign something   they cannot do, or won't wish to do; their goal during the interview should   be persuading me that they can possibly do something. I then customarily meet   interns once or twice a week, so they can show me what they've done. At times   they challenge one another with practical problems or theoretical inquiries;   other times they exchange intelligence and/or computer programs.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> It is important that the   contributions of interns be publicly acknowledged. Should interns proofread   a book of mine, I'll put their names in the preface; should another design a   book, his or her name will appear on the copyright page. Interns' names appear   on audiotapes and videotapes. Should someone assist me every step of the way,   as the CUNY musicology graduate student Joseph Darby did for the book<i> Nicolas   Slonimsky: The First 100 Years</i> (1994), his name belongs on the book's title   page. Should someone be essential to the completion of the piece, as Hebrew-speaker   Ophir Finkelthal was for my audio composition <i>Kaddish</i>, I'll append his   name to mine. (You can imagine how a production credit from Westdeutscher Rundfunk   affected his career as a graduate student at the U.S.C. film school.) Many remain   friends; a few have become partners in other projects.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Since I dislike "rejecting"   people, I accept anyone who seems sufficiently trained and enthusiastic. I've   learned after twenty years that I cannot tell in an interview who can do work   and who can't. I generally assign a modest task--editing a manuscript, designing   a few pages of text, making an inventory the imagery on an videotape--simply   to see whether they proceed to the next step. If they cannot do something small,   there is no reason to assign something bigger. One truth is that I never hear   from or about any of the dropouts again. Whatever happened to them, none ever   became literary-art professionals.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> I've had interns from   Columbia, New York University, Yale, Brown, College of St. Elizabeth, Kutztown   State, Ithaca, Fredonia State, Northwestern, Rhode Island School of Design,   Pratt, Skidmore, Stanford, Trinity, Bennington, Antioch, Wesleyan, Barnard,   Borough of Manhattan Community College, and City University's graduate school,   among other institutions; and you can't tell me that those from one school are   necessarily better prepared to accomplish work than others. The only measure   is work itself--not only the initial test but the quality of the final project.   The best interns have been young people who for one reason or another have wanted   to work with me; they already knew my work or had heard about my program from   a previous intern.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Internships are not remunerative   because most of us with spare money would surely hire someone with demonstrated   experience over someone with none. Should any prospective intern ask to be paid,   my policy is to excuse them immediately. Expecting to get money from noncommercial   artists, such as literary writers, is similar to hustling change from street   beggars--it marks someone as a fool. I'm not a professor with a budget for employing   graduate assistants. (Anyone expecting to earn money should go where the money   is.) There are exceptions. If the intern's work generates income for me, they   are entitled to a share; when flush, I've hired a former intern to do more of   the kind of work they'd previously done competently. Conversely, one implicit   rule is that you can only ask an intern to complete the same sort of task once;   once competence had been established with finished work, he or she should be   paid.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Besides, a successful   intern will ultimately earn more from his work with me than I could ever make   from them. Just as Peter Longauer built his animation career upon gratis collaboration   with me, so others have gotten fellowships and jobs. Two recent RISD graduates   who designed and partially typeset my <i>Wordworks: Poems Selected & New</i>   (BOA, 1993) later worked as staff designers at Scholastic magazine. Another   who brilliantly edited a million-word manuscript of mine was recently offered   a graduate fellowship of eleven thousand dollars a year for five years. I saw   the unique name of an intern on the masthead of short-lived Video magazine.   I'd like to think that work they did gratis for me contributed to their worldly   success.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2">Neither are internships   substitutes for educational deficiencies. Since film production was among my   fields, I would get for years queries from students attending schools where   film and/or video production was not (or barely) taught. If someone wants a   cheap education in film or video, my advice is to take not a menial job with   a film company but a production course at a convenient community college.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> I once thought it desirable   to have students get course credit or satisfy some other institutional requirement,   but now believe these mechanisms are counter-productive. If a person successfully   completes tasks, nothing need be written; if he or she fails, I've found myself   signing, out of obligation to the internship contract, a document reporting   that an intern working mostly on his own says he spent eighty hours completing   work that should have taken him or her no more than twenty (indicating that   he or she is either disingenuous or dim). Recently, one of these barely competent   students received from his university an A an internship in which only the first   in a succession of three possible typographic designs was completed, raising   the question of whether her university did either her or the school a favor   by rewarding insufficient work.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> I get ripped off when   I devote a certain amount of attention and sometimes material to someone who   produces nothing. All you have in life is time, and if neither of us is rewarded   for the time allocated, then someone has been gyped. Perhaps because application   to me is more open than elsewhere, I've been ripped off more than once; and   especially in the wake of a run of incompetents, I wonder if this is worth continuing.   (All those unfinished projects persuade me otherwise.) Some interns cheat themselves   when they fail to complete a project on which they start, for any dormant project   can be offered to another intern.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> What I want ultimately   is to have an intern finish something to which he can affix his name, no matter   how long it takes. One intern who a few summers ago put her name on a videotape,   a film, and the index of a book is now employed at the New York Center for Visual   History. What I don't want to do is have to write a platitudinous letter, saying   that so-and-so showed up on time five days a week for six weeks or, worse, that   he or she tried hard, had plenty of excuses, but accomplished little or nothing.   When attached to applications for real jobs, such letters are less persuasive   than work bearing the applicant's name.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> I think of myself as a   facilitator who can lead horses to water but cannot make them drink. Though   my internships are challenging, in ways that professional life is tough, generosity   and flexibility are key tokens--for me as well as them--in a successful internship.   How young people handle the opportunities granted them to complete work on their   own can become a sure measure of subsequent professional success--indeed a better   measure than a college transcript. I'd like to think as well that I'm giving   my interns the kind of pre-professional experience I wish I had at their age.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> --##-- </font></p></body></html>
