Where most of the pages         of the first book mixed stories that were no more than three words in         length, this will be divided into sections exploring various extreme constraints.         The sections entitled "One-Word Stories," "Two-Word Stories," and "Three-Word         Stories" are what their titles say. "Skeletal Stories" likewise have three         words, but they are physically separate from one another and syntactically         discontinuous within a single horizontal line. "Two-Element Stories" suggest         a narrative between them with neither word necessarily opening the story;         the same multivalent principle applies to "Three-Element Stories." "Shorters"         classifies syntactically conventional sentences that either complete or         suggest a narrative wholly within themselves, as no sentence intentionally         compliments any of the others in the collection, except in form. Whereas         the stories in <i>Minimal Fictions</i> were imaginatively designed on         a computer, the manuscript of <b>More Minimal Fiction</b> is for now standard         in appearance. Its innovations notwithstanding, my fiction is acknowledged         in such compendia as the <i>Columbia Literary History of the United States</i>,         <i>Contemporary Novelists</i> (St. James), <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia         of Literature</i>, <i>Webster Dictionary of American Literature</i>,<i>         Postmodern Fiction</i> (Greenwood), and <i>A Reader¹s Guide to 20th Century         Writers</i> (Oxford), where my name is featured among a thousand authors         living and dead, the anonymous commentator writing that Kostelanetz "represents         the farthest extreme of the formalist approach within the broader field         of Œexperimental writing.¹ He goes much farther along the route more popularly         associated with Georges Perec." The writer continues, "His output in Œvisual         poetry,¹ a medium between poetry and painting which differs from most         concrete poetry by being non-linear and non-syntactic, is among his most         significant work." Publishers wishing to consider <b>More Minimal Fictions</b>         or the poetry companion <b>More Wordworks</b> should contact the author         at the address at the top of this page. </font></p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
