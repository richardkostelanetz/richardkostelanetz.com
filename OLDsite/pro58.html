These   tapes can be divided into three groups:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 1.) early works, including   <i>Three Prose Pieces</i> (1975, 20¹), <i>Openings & Closings</i> (1975, 56:10),   <i>Declaration of Independence</i> (1979, 9:20), and <i>Epiphanies</i> (1980,   31:00), all of which are based upon prose texts of his. A retrospective videotape   almost entirely about this work in the context of his SoHo studio, including   his spoken commentary, is <i>Video Writing</i> (1987, 53:110).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 2.) Recent works whose   screen content is exclusively linguistic: <i>Partitions</i> (1986, 27:140),   <i>Kinetic Writings</i> (1989, 22¹), <i>Video Strings</i> (1989, 29:32), <i>Stringsieben</i>   (1989, 12:00, in German), <i>Turfs/Grounds/Lawns</i> (1989, 23:00. (Two 60¹   tapes in progress, awaiting support sufficient to complete editing, are Video   Poems and Video Fictions.)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 3.) Recent works whose   continuous abstract syntheses are a counterpoint to language-based electro-acoustic   music: <i>Invocations</i> (1981-4, 61'), <i>The Gospels Abridged</i> (1988,   62¹), <i>Two Sacred Texts</i> (1988, 12¹), <i>Two Erotic Videotapes</i> (1988,   56:10). It should be noted that one of the <i>Sacred Texts</i>, <i>Praying to   the Lord</i>, is available in eight separate realizations, towards an eight-monitor   installation, while five alternative versions of Invocations are also available,   each beginning with a language family different from the English on the original:   (a) Latin; (b) German; (c) Hebrew-Assyriac; (d) Italian-Yugoslav-Greek; (e)   Swedish-Danish. <i>Americas¹ Game</i> (2000, 60¹) represents a new departure   in having a representational image accompany an audiotape composition less of   language as such than a fuller range of sounds, in this case those unique to   baseball. These tapes are available on 3/4" U-Matic or 1/2" VHS cassettes, in   the NTSC format, ideally for continuous viewing over a period of time. Those   marked * have a hifi stereo soundtrack; those marked ** are best viewed over   large-screen projection TV.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Possible venues could   include libraries as well as museums, as no other American author has worked   as long or as often in video. Any institutions seriously wishing to mount this   exhibition are advised to contact him at the address at the top of this page.   Thank you. </font> </p></body></html>
