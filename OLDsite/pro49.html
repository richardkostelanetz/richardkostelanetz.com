Since   these are meant to be the encompassing climactic moments--Epiphanies, in the   Joycean sense--of longer, otherwise nonexistent narratives, my principal request   of the director and performers is that they do their best to read each sentence   in a way that evocatively communicates a sense of what the remaining, implicit   story might be. Any number of performers may sit or stand as they wish, in a   proscenium or an open space, in neutral dress; and there is no need to costume   or mime any activities, since it is assumed that most, if not all, of the action   is in the lines and how they are spoken. The performers are functioning more   like an ensemble of musicians who play their solos on cue. For the premiere   performance, directed by Suzanne Bennett at the University of North Dakota,   the lines were read one at a time, with great pauses between, by four informally   dressed, standing performers distributed around the circumference of a circle   made by the audience seated in the middle (in an inversion of the traditional   "theater-in-the-round"). From the manuscript, the director chose those Epiphanies   she preferred, had them copied onto individual 3" by 5" cards, and then distributed   these cards over large tables, inviting the four performers to choose those   cards each felt he or she could articulate best. The director then assigned   some of the remaining Epiphanies to those performers she thought could render   them best. (No director is obliged to use all the lines; none of them is necessarily   more essential to the whole than any of the others.) Appropriate direction should   emphasize the individuality of each story and thus avoid, in assigning the stories,   giving recurring personas to one or another reader and likewise avoid, in the   ordering of elements, suggesting any relation between the story at hand and   any other near it. Though the original production had stories emerging in succession   from various points around a circle, other directors might want to have them   spoken, if not dramatized, in other ways; other kinds of theatrical spaces are   also feasible. A subsequent production took place within an art exhibition gallery   at Vassar College, with spectators scattered about; and since this director,   E. St. John Villard, instructed her dozen performers to speak often in canon   or unison, she used approximately three times as many stories within a production   that took just as long as the initial one--forty-five minutes. Moreover, as   the order of the lines need not be fixed, I could envision the director changing   the sequence from performance to performance in an extended run, or the performers   exchanging Epiphanies with one another, in part to keep their renditions continually   fresh. There is no doubt in my mind that different groups will (and should)   perform Epiphanies in totally different ways, much as Gertrude Stein's similarly   open texts are susceptible to radically different theatrical interpretations;   and the length of a performance could vary from a few minutes to several hours.   Despite possible variations in interpretation, the text has its own intelligence;   it will always be about one theme that is unique to it: the exhaustive experience   of the experience of story.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> So to answer the conventional   production questions: <b>Epiphanies</b> is a text for any number of performers   of any sex, size and shape, for performance at any length, with no scenery,   in any sort of performance space. At issue, to be frank, is a desire to realize   the unusual concept. </font> </p></body></html>
