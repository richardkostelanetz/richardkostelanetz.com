The MacArthur fellowship   that she received in 1997 is one sign of this recognition; another is her international   touring throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. Though   she has recently presented her pieces at the Joyce Theater in New York, she   has also explored such alternative venues as a platform beside the boardwalk   at Coney Island and the beach in Miami.. Choreographing since 1979, she founded   in 1985 her company, called simply Streb.. In her current brochures, she prints   five epithets that define her art: "Ricochet, Crash, BreakThru, Catapult, Air   Hurdle." The first radical idea was the use of props not as extensions, as Alwin   Nikolais had done, but as resistances. So her dancers crashed into walls and   wooden planks and dove fist-firstthrough a pane of glass. More recently acquiring   two world-class trampolines, she is exploring possible movements for dancers   suspended in mid-air. My sense is that out of post-Merce Cunningham avant-garde   dance come two directions--one emphasizing alternative movements within a dance   tradition, the other incorporating nondance activities for dancers. If Mark   Morris for one represents he former, Streb epitomizes the latter. Early in her   career she received from Cunningham¹s lifetime collaborator John Cage this mash   note: "When I first saw Elizabeth Streb¹s wori, I was exhilarated. Her energy,   inventiveness, uninterrupted attentionaire are great. Every time I hear that   she is dancing, I arrange to see her work."</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> What I would like to do   is the first book that would tell of her life, his esthetic, and the development   of her art, with photographs and other documentation. It can be done to any   length and size the publisher thinks appropriate. Enclosed is a revision of   an article done for Brooklyn Bridge magazine. </font></p></body></html>
