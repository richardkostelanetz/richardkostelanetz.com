(Oxford Univ., 1983)Carolyn Brown, "On Chance," Ballet Review (Summer 1968)Noel Carroll and Sally Banes, "Cunningnam and Duchamp," Ballet Review (Summer 1983)Selma Jeanne Cohen, ed., "Time To Walk in Space: Essays, Stories, and Remarks," with contributions by Carolyn Brown, John Cage, Arlene Croce, Merce Cunningham, Edwin Denby, Jill Johnston, David Vaughan, Dance Perspectives, 3/4 (Summer 1968)Merce Cunningham, "The Impermanent Art," Seven Arts (1955); "Choreography and the Dancer," in The Creative Experience (Grossman, 1970)Richard Kostelanetz, "Twenty Years of Cunningham Dance," On Innovative Performance(s) (McFarland, 1991);  "Cunningham/ Cage," On Innovative Music(ian)s (Limelight, 1989)
