Kostelanetz attended Brown University (B.A., 1962), Columbia University         (M.A., 1966), and King's College, London. He served as visiting professor         or guest artist at a variety of institutions and lectured widely. In 1971,         employing a radically formalist approach, Kostelanetz produced the novel         <i>In the Beginning</i>, which consists of the alphabet, in single- and         double-letter combinations, unfolding over 30 pages. Most of his other         literary work also challenges the reader in unconventional ways and is         often printed in limited editions at small presses. Kostelanetz's nonfiction         work <i>The End of Intelligent Writing: Literary Politics in America</i>         (1974) charged the New York literary and publishing establishment with         inhibiting the publishing and promotion of works by innovative younger         authors. His "visual poetry" consists of arrangements of words on a page,         using such devices as linking language and sequence, punning, alliteration,         parallelism, constructivism, and minimalism. Among his other works are         <i>Recyclings: A Literary Autobiography </i>(1974, 1984)<i>, Politics         in the African-American</i> <i>Novel</i> (1991), <i>Published Encomia,         1967-91</i> (1991), and <i>On Innovative Art(ist)s</i> (1992). His films         include <i>A Berlin Lost</i> (1984) and<i> Berlin Sche-Einena Jother </i>(1988),         both with Martin Koerber.Kostelanetz issued many recordings and audiocassettes         on his own label and edited works on musicians such as B.B. King and Philip         Glass. His <i>A Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes</i> was published in 1999.         </font></p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
