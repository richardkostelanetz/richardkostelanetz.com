In the piece opening this program, the voice you just heard--indeed, all the voices you heard--were my own, electronically manipulated through a tape-delay loop to enhance the simple phrase "This is my poem" into a verbal-audio experience that is quite different from the original four-word text, and different as well from what I, or anyone else, could have done a few generations ago.  I call such works Audio Writing, because this is literature that can exist--that can be published--only on audiotape. (Play "Excelsior", 1:20)   The text of that last story is restricted to one-word paragraphs that I wrote in the late 1960s.  In this tape, made in 1975, the voices on both sides of the stereophony resemble each other.  You might wonder if the two voices are perhaps one, seducing himself or itself, so to speak.  But perhaps not.  If this text were realized on television or in film or in live performance, you would be able to see the speakers and thereby resolve an issue that exclusively in sound remains ambiguous.  One attraction of audio is this:  By forbidding you to see, it forces you to imagine.   When I wrote books, I wanted to utilize the unique capabilities of printed pages. Now when I work with audiotape, as an audio author, I want again to do what cannot be done in any other medium.  Instead of giving my texts to someone else to produce, I have gone into audio studios myself, producing my own tapes with the assistance of sympathetic engineers.  (play "Milestones in a Life" 3:55)   You just heard how technologies of sound modification can be used to propell a voice through domains that can be imagined, but cannot, and need not, be visually portrayed.  In this case, the voice is my own, reading a story of mine, about the single most important events, or milestones, in a bourgois life.   Next is a chorus of four voices speaking a sequence of poems of mine that, in their visual form, have only four words, one in each corner of the page.  As no word in these verbal quartets is necessarily more important than the others, the four words in these poems, when read by the eye, are meant to be perceived simultaneously, in a single visual-verbal perception.  So, I thought, it would be appropriate, and interesting, to hear the four words simultaneously, as a sort of verbal chord or, in this case, as a succession of verbal chords.  (Play a minute of "Turfs/Areans/Fields/Pitches"   Only once, in the following piece, did I introduce an element I never used again--a musical accompaniment that here functions as a monophonic complement to my solo speech.  In general, as my visual poems are always composed of words and nothing but words, so have my sound poems been limited to words.  To my penchant for esthetic purism, this work, titled "Plateaux," remains the sole exception.  (Play "Plateaux", 4:00)   In 1975, I published <i>Openings & Closings</i>, a book of single-sentence stories that are meant to be either the opening sentences of hypothetical longer stories, or the closing sentences of hypothetically previous stories.    My idea, as the author, was to make the sentence, and the sentence alone, suggest the fiction that might have come after, or might have come before.  As these are all autonomous stories, there is no connection between any opening or any closing--indeed, no connection between one story and any other in the collection.   In the book, the openings are set in italic type; the closings in roman type.  On audiotape, the openings emerge from one side of a stereo system; the closings from the other.  The former were all recorded through a microphone close to my voice; the latter from a distant microphone.  Beyond these generic differentiations, I tried to give each story an acoustic ambience different from those around it.  That is, I wanted each new story to come from someplace else in acoustic space and, thus, a different literary space.   (Play two minutes, or so)   My earliest audio pieces were based upon texts of mine; before long, I realized that I could also use my audio techniques to adapt traditional texts much as a musician does--to give them a different sound.  As Bach took the words of the New Testament's passions, so I took "The Lord's Prayer" in English and then a comparably central Hebrew prayer and, needless to say perhaps, did in an audio studio what Bach could not do, not only in escalating my own voice into choruses of respectively 8 voices, 64 voices and 512 voices, but also in making prayers of two religions, in different languages, sound almost identical.  (play "Praying to the Lord", 5:40)   Here and elsewhere, religious materials strike me as especially suitable for electronic enhancement, which generally increases suggestions of superhuman sacredness.  Sometime after completing this last work, which I call "Praying to the Lord," I came across R. Murray Schafer's observation, in ~The Tuning of the~ World~ (1977), "It was not until the Renaissance that God became portraiture.   Previously He had been conceived as sound or vibration."  In the back of my mind, when I began this piece, was the experience, the previous summer, of seeing the valley to the west of Mount Sinai, and then imagining the presence of thousands of noisy Israelites waiting for Moses to return.  Vibration, I now thought, could also be interpreted, or imagined, as the sound of the multitudes venerating God.  Murray Schafer's perspicacious remark also reminds me of Marshall McLuhan's observation that electronic media of communication recreate the sensory experience of preprint peoples.  (Play duet of Lord's Prayers, in German-English, :30)   In 1981, while a guest of the DAAD Kunstlerprogramm in Berlin, I taped over sixty Berlin ministers reciting prayers in two dozen languages.   Thanks to a residency at the Electronic Music Studio of Stockholm, where I had access to a twenty-four track tape system, these prayers were mixed into overlapping solos, duets (as you just heard), quintets and choruses that were then assembled into a piece one hour long, titled ~Invocations~.  (Play the sequence of Lord's Prayers from the beginning of side 2 of <i>Invocations</i>)   After doing mostly short works, I wanted to make an audio piece as long as an oratorio is long and actually had in mind the structural example of an even longer work, Johann Sebastian Bach's ~St. Matthew Passion~.  Another theme in my head at that time comes from James Joyce's ~Finnegans Wake~, and that is the theme of telling the same story in many interwoven languages.   In my case, my theme was that sound that makes all prayers sound ultimately alike, which is to say the metalanguage of prayer.  (Play Murdoch and the Sufi, 6:10)   One crucial difference between this last work and its predecessors is <i>Invocations</i> lacks either a text I wrote or a text I chose; my plan, in beginning <i>Invocations</i>~, was no more than a concept.  (Similarly, the score, which was done in retrospect, is only a time-chart that notes chronologically which minister is speaking when.)   One quality I like about this piece comes from putting into the same acoustic space prayers that would not otherwise be heard together, and for that fact alone the work is meant to be ecumenical.  When it was first played on New York radio, the composer Tui St. George Tucker telephoned to suggest, appropriately, "This must be what God hears."  (Play Green-Pache duet, 1;37)   Inspired by the audiofugues of Glenn Gould's radio documentaries, I thought, as early as 1976, of experimenting with the experience of hearing four different voices speaking the first four books of the New Testament simultaneously.   The Gospels struck me as an especially appropriate text, not only because they tell the same story in four different ways, but because that story and its phrases are so familiar that the audience need not follow the plot or understand every word to recognize it.  (Play beginning, for a minute or so)   I was also interested in creating a sound piece that would be so long, while its purposes would always be so present, that the listener could neglect it for a while--even walk away--and still resume the experience when he or she returned, much as the Bible itself is customarily read not in a single sitting but put side, to be read in discontinuous snatches.  This constant presentness is a radical structure I associate with John Cage's musical theater pieces of the past two decades, as well as Merce Cunningham's dance.  (Play, for another or so, an especially luminous passage)   One reason why the spectator can miss passages in my <i>Gospels</i>, or Cunningham-Cage, is that the work is continuously about the same thing, which is the style of itself.  In my piece, this "thing" is the fugal experience of the four Gospels or, to put it differently, the experience not of Matthew, John, Luke and Mark but of an Ur-Gospel I call Matthew-John-Luke-Mark, from which perhaps the others are descended.  My proposal to fugue the Gospels was commissioned by Westdeutscher Rundfunk in 1980, the speakers were recorded in 1981, and the tracks were mixed in 1982.  Since my knowledge of German is scanty, Klaus Sch&ouml;ning, my producer at WDR, was kind enough to commission an English version which became a sort of warm-up for the German version he broadcast.  (Play the opening 55' of German fugue)   Now that I was working with sacred texts in languages other than my own, I thought of inverting the idea of <i>Invocations</i>.  If that piece was concerned with similarities of prayers in many languages, its inverse would explore a single prayer that is spoken by people from many places, by people with many accents.   My initial thought was the <i>Dies Irae</i>, or Latin prayer for the dead; I thought next of the <i>Kaddish</i>, or the Hebrew prayer for the dead.  I would still like to work with either of these sacred texts.   Nonetheless, my first test of this idea was the traditional prayer for the Jewish holiday of Hanukah.  I asked the CBC, which commissioned this piece in 1983, to record Hebrew speakers with widest variety of accents, from the widest variety of places; and received tapes spoken in both Askenazic and Sephardic Hebrew, by individuals from Poland, Germany, Latin America, North Africa, South Africa, Canada, and, of course, North America.  Since Hanukah has eight nights, and Jews observing it customarily light an extra candle for each successive night, I decided to give my piece eight movements.  The first would have a solo voice reciting the Hanukah prayer; the second movement, two voices reciting the same prayer in staggered succession; and the last, a canon of eight voices to correspond to the eight candles of the eighth day.  To begin to hear variations in Hebrew pronunciation, listen to how differently the word for God, ~Adonoi~ or ~Adonai~, is spoken.  (Play ~The Eight Nights of Hanukah~, 5:20)   Religious language interests me; so does the erotic, as was clear at the beginning of this retrospective, perhaps because of this practical compositional principle: If you want to tell a story in an unusual way, choose a plot everyone knows.  As I moved further into sophisticated multitracking of sacred texts, so I did likewise with erotic texts.  Another 1981 audiotape draws upon my story entitled "Seductions" that was published in my second collection, <i>More Short Fictions</i> (1980).   In that book the text appears as a single paragraph of prose in sixteen different styles of typeface.  In each typeface is a complete narrative that is here, one sentence at a time, intermittently interwoven with the others.   Each of the sixteen stories deals with the male narrator's memory of a hetereosexual seduction, for the fiction as a whole is about unity (of a single repeated plot) amid diversity.   For the audiotape I duplicated the printed structure of sixteen typefaces, telling each story in an audibly different amplification of my own voice, which is the acoustic analogue of a distinctly different typeface.  The sixteen stories, as told by sixteen different voices of myself, were then cut apart into sentences that were, as in the printed version, reassembled into a continuous stream, now a tape, that jumps from one voice to another, until all the stories become a single audio story with sixteen interwoven voices.  (Play a few minutes from the beginning)   For another text about erotic experience, "Relationships," I again had to deal with defining differences amid similarities in an essentially repetitious text--defining these differences initially in prose and then with electronic audio enhancements.  (Play a minute or so, probably from the middle)   While both "Seductions" and "Relationships" are explicitly erotic, other works are only implicitly so.  "Foreshortenings & Other Stories" has a mastertext of eighty-four short sentences that, alternating from him to her, tell of a boy meeting and eventually seducing a girl.   In the first of several variations, the text is repeated with alternate sentences omitted and the opening pronouns changed; so that the initial six sentences become three sentences.  As all variations have the structure of a dialogue, we hear my solo voice alternating with a chorus of my voice multiplied into a quartet (playing from tape, reading/translating first if necessary): He met her in the park. She asked him for a light. He responded to her. She noticed his hands. He was struck by her silky blonde hair. She liked the shape of his eyebrows.In the second section of "Foreshortenings," these six sentences become three:  He met her in the park. She responded to him. He was struck by her silky blonde hair.And in the third section, these three sentences become two: He met her in the park. She was struck by his silky blonde hair.And so on, until several sections later, the eighty-four sentences are foreshortened into one.  (Play just: He met her in the park.)  In the other stories in this group, the same original text is manipulated in other systematic ways, even though the performance is always a dialogue.  In the following excerpt, from the beginning of "Reversing," her forty-two lines are heard in their original sequence, while his forty-two are heard in reverse order, completely changing the sexual-emotional tone.  (play for twelve lines)   I should explain why you hear so many duets with myself in these tapes.  That is a result less of choice than a lack of it.  Most of my earlier works were produced on shoestring budgets, late at night, in audio studios donated to me, with only an engineer and myself present; and the other guy had to man the recording console.  (Play another variation of <i>Foreshortenings</i>.)   Perhaps the most subtle of my erotic stories is a series of pieces called "Conversations" that I decided to do in elementary German.  Here the words for Yes, No and Sure--Yah, Nein and Doch--were processed over two dozen times through a Fairlight CMI--those initials standing for "Computer Music Instrument"--to interact in various ways and suggest, in passing, several kinds of positive-negative interaction.  (play several samples)   Another experimental text of mine with this quality of continuous presence is "Declaration of Independence," which is my counter-syntactical reworking of that historic American document.  How, I asked myself, can I declare my independence from conventional language?  One answer was to divorce language from syntax.  So, in 1976, the year of the American bicentennial, I took that traditional text and simply rewrote it backwards, word for word, so that its familiar vocabulary and phrases are grammatically askew.  Once in a multitrack studio, I decided to declaim my own "Declaration of Independence," as this text is also called, in eight different, but almost synchronous, versions of my own voice, transforming myself into a ragged choir reminiscent of Protestant congregations. (Play two minutes from it from the beginning)   Another group of my experimental texts I call "Strings," because they are continuous sequences of letters that are composed of overlapping words; so that each new word contains at least three letters of its predecessor. "Stringfive," for instance, opens with these letters (spell out): v-e-t-e-r-a-n-c-i-d-e-r, which incorporate in sequence the words "veteran," "rancid," and "cider."  This process of letter-overlapping is extended for several hundred letters, without duplicating any words or allowing any space between letters.  Now this concept of a string is so fertile that I have written similarly structured texts in French, German and Swedish.  For audio performance, I have asked especially dextrous readers to pronounce every syllable in a continuous stream, from which all sounds of breathing would be edited away, thereby duplicating continuously on tape the visual display of uninterrupted letters.   So far only one performer has done this right, and that is the eminent German flutist Eberhard Blum, to whom the German "Stringsieben" was dedicated.  (play two minutes from the beginning, and fade down)   <i>New York City</i> is the place where I was born and have always lived; it is also the name of a piece of literary audio art I completed in 1984.  My initial ambition was to write a sort of <i>Under Milk Wood</i> about my hometown; but after drafting a few passages, I realized that the radio artist in the late twentieth century would do better working with audio technologies unavailable to Dylan Thomas only three decades ago.  Instead of writing lines for actors to speak, I recorded sounds that I felt were unique to New York, announcing, merely by their sound, that they came from nowhere else in the world.  When I took all my field recordings into the Stockholm studio, however, I was less interested in documenting scenes than in combining sounds, often from disparate sources, to evoke sonic qualities that I regarded as indigenous to New York.  This is less about New York, as such, than the experience of its indigenous sound.  (play Times Square passage, 6:40)   Since the German radio station commissioning my <i>New York City</i> wanted a piece much shorter than what I had in mind, the work presently exists in two lengths--one 140 minutes long, which I call the American version; and an International version sixty minutes long, with considerably less speech, that was broadcast over Westdeutscher Rundfunk in April, 1984.  In the American version alone are mixes like the following, with New Yorkers talking as only New Yorkers can talk.  (play the mix based upon the welfare office, 3:45)   Of several audio works in progress, the most ambitious is <i>Epiphanies</i>, which is based upon a new collection of single-sentence stories written by me.  These new sentences are meant to represent the Epiphanies in the James Joycean sense--the most resonant moments--in otherwise unwritten fictions.  As in <i>Openings & Closings</i>, these stories have no connection to each other, in either time or space, and are thus separated from each other in the greatest variety of acoustic ways.  Over fifty readers, with distinctive voices, were recruited, to produce a rough tape that is several hours long.   What I am doing now is using all kinds of amplification devices to give each story an acoustic setting both appropriate and unique to it.  With nearly two thousand stories, in a work meant to be perhaps four hours long, my audio ~Epiphanies~ are still in progress.  (Now play two minutes or so)   While I mean these <i>Epiphanies</i> to be heard as a continuous tape that, like other long works of mine, can be left and returned to, I'm also thinking of distributing my audio <i>Epiphanies</i> to public radio stations in very small units, ranging from, say, thirty seconds to a few minutes.  These very short programs could then be spontaneously plugged into the empty spaces of public programming--spaces where the advertisements go on commercial stations--as a radical kind of continuing, but discontinuous, unscheduled serial.  (Play perhaps twenty seconds.)   I have also been working with the composer Bruce Kushnick to produce for radio an operator version with Epiphanies composed for just my works, my words set to music, or just his music.  We want to make a comic radio opera, if not the funniest ever made, or at least the funniest radio opera that is not essentially a parody of opera.   Here is a sample of our work in progress:   The main distinguishing characteristics of my audiotapes so far have been, first, the use of inventive, uncommon language structures, whether one-word paragarphs, one-line stories, or nonsyntactic sentences; a penchant for musical forms in organizing language; the exploitation of the technologies available in a contemporary multitrack studio; and then the realization of aural-verbal  experiences that would be unfeasible, if not impossible, in live performance.  I consider all these pieces literature, because they are all based upon language or literary ideas; but whereas writers, even self-styled radio writers, have traditionally worked exclusively with rectangular pages, I have come to work directly with audiotape, discovering for myself, by myself, the literary possibilities of electronic pages, or media, that are new to the late twentieth century and thus call the whole of this work "Audio Writing."
