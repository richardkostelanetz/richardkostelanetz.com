Its themes would include the   individuality of people known intimately, the variousness of affection, and   the unpredictable selectivity of memory. I chose a form that would force me   to be concise, but would not artificially organize intrinsically miscellaneous   perceptions. The material is basically autobiographical, although many details   have been disguised without jeopardizing more essential authenticities. Since   the subject is my experience and memory, I would be alarmed if any reader saw   herself, or anyone known to her or him, in these portraits. These resemble my   earlier Portraits from Memory (Ardis, 1975; RK Editions, 1980), only in subject   and form--one page per person. Among the secondary themes known to me are the   irrationality of love and the contingency and thus unpredictability of failure   and success in relationships, as well as the essential mystery of who is remembered   and who not, and why. For one practical reason or another, some pages of the   entire manuscript are not available for publication at this time. Any combination   of these portraits (pages) may be published at any time, though I hope that   editors will publish enough of them to respect the themes noted above. I thought   about publishing these portraits under a pseudonym, but evasions have never   been an element of my style. Were I reborn as a woman, I would hope to write   a sequel; as a man, I'd love to read it. Should any publisher wish to consider   the complete manuscript, please let me hear from you. Thanks. </font> </p></body></html>
