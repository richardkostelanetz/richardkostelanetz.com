This lecture   draws upon articles published in various places over the past two decades and   in The Grants Fix.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 2) John Cage and Moholy-Nagy   as Polyartists, with slides and audiotape. As the descriptive title implies,   this will demonstrate how works in various arts reflect common esthetic principles   particular to each major figure.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 3) Innovative Literature   in America Today, likewise with slides and audiotape, focusing not only upon   visual and aural literature but upon radical departures in language style and   literary structure.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 4) Writing Extended, also   with slides and tapes: A comprehensive introduction to my own work in poetry,   fiction, audiotape, videotape, photography, holography, and film.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 5) Audio Writing, an introduction   to my own work with audiotape, with many short examples and live commentary.   Longer works of my Audio Art available for concerts include Invocations (in   25 languages, for 61 minutes); The Gospels (in English, 120 minutes, or in German   as Die Evangelien, 60 minutes); New York City, which comes in two lengths--one   60' international version, the other a 140' American version, both composed   of sounds particular to my hometown, which can be played in conjunction with   an elaborate slide presentation involving hundreds of comparable New York City   images. These works are particularly effective in sequence and in daytime venues.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 6) The Radio Art of Glenn   Gould--an introduction, with audiotape, to the remarkably unknown "docudramas"   produced by the great Canadian musician.<br>  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 7) Epiphanies, which is   the collective title for a multimedia work of single-sentence stories whose   text is available for an exhibition or theatrical presentation and on a film,   a videotape, an audiotape, parts or all of which can be used in either a single   presentation, a series or an installation.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 8) Numbers: Poems & Stories:   My most popular show, with slides and commentary, of my art composed entirely   of numerals--given in other fifty venues over the past few years.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 9) A Berlin Lost/Ein Verlorenes   Berlin/Berlin Perdu/Ett Forlorat Berlin/El Berlin Perdido/Berlin Sche-Einena   Jother, my six 21¹ films with different soundtracks, respectively in English,   German, French, Swedish, Spanish, and Hebrew, of authentic testimony about the   Great Jewish Cemetery of Berlin as the principal surviving represention of pre-WWII   Berlin and its greatest years. These films are best shown in sequence, as the   imagery begs to be reseen. I can provide printed English translations for those   films not in English. When I show the films myself, I can answer questions about   the cemetery and these stylistically unusual documentaries (e.g, devoid of talking   heads). The films themselves are available from Goethe House for screening without   me; videotape copies also exist in 3/4" and 1/2" VHS formats.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 10) A John Cage Circus,   to which I can bring a large number of 6 & 8-hour audio-only hi-fi stereo VHS   tapes containing a complete survey of Cagean performance, in addition to some   video about Cage in which I appear. This is best presented simultaneously in   several acoustically separate spaces, some of which may include lie performances   of Cage¹s work prepared in advance by associates/students of the sponsor. I   will be centrally available to answer questions, etc.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 11) Visual Poetry & Visual   Fiction: Another traditional slide show, with voice-over narration, of my own   early exploratory work--likewise given over fifty times.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 12) The American Tradition   of Radio Drama, which suggests, with taped examples, that, while we had little   radio drama on the Anglo-European model, we had instead something they lacked,   radio comedy, whose principal practitioners discovered the unique possibilities   of radio art.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 13) Gertrude Stein as   the Great American Person of Avant-Garde Letters: The only utterly straight   lecture, with neither slides nor audiotapes, that I can be persuaded to give.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Wordsand, my small exhibition   of language art in various media, is still available for touring, having already   visited several institutions in the past few years. It includes prints (already   matted, but needing covering frames), book-art books, audiotapes, videotapes   and a film. I am also putting together an exhibition, more suitable for libraries   than galleries, of the more than three dozen Anthologies I have edited over   the past few years.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> I am in general willing   to visit classes, particularly if I can discuss works I have done or am doing.   (See enclosed resume.) For all concerned, a series of presentations, stretching   over a few consecutive days, is worth more than just a single shot. My fees   can be characterized as mid-range and, of course, become less per day for extended   stays; but bear in mind that just as some artist/writers teach so that they   can do other things for nothing, the firmest base of my sporadic income is touring.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Sponsors in New York State   can get supplementary funds from Poets & Writers, 72 Spring St., New York, NY   10012 (212-226-3586); for my concerts including my tapes from Meet the Composer,   2112 Broadway, New York, NY 10023 (212-787-3601). Sponsors in other states,   as well as New York, should consider approaching the appropriate departments   of the NEA for further supplementary funding. Bear in mind that these organizations   must be contacted well in advance of my presentations for funds to be made available.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Past sponsors of over   two hundred presentations have included art museums, alternative spaces, cultural   centers and university departments of literature, art, music, speech, media,   intermedia, American studies and combinations of them, as well as student organizations.   My social security number is 059-32-4341. If you have any questions, don't hesitate   to ask; and if you don't hear from me at once, the best assumption is not that   I'm dilatory but that I'm on tour and will get back to you as soon as I return.   I look forward to your response.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Cordially yours, Richard   Kostelanetz </font> </p></body></html>
