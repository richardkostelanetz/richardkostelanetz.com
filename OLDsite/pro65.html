(made in collaboration   with Martin Koerber, 1984), was to film a visual representation of a city¹s   greatest years, in this case the Jewish cemetery of Berlin‹Weissensee, and then   compose a soundtrack about the life represented in the footage. Since the interviewees,   all Berliners, never appear on screen, we were able to produce fresh soundtracks,   wholly composed of authentic testimony, in German, French, Spanish, Swedish   and Hebrew, as well as English. For a sequel about the nadir of a city, again   Berlin, I wish to take the extraordinary evocative aerial footage that American   airmen shot of Berlin in April 1945, showing, unlike no other footage known   to me, a modern city in ruins. To this footage, which is available in both color   and black-white from the U.S. government merely for the cost of copying, I may   add footage and/or stills gathered from other sources and/or enhanced by optical   processing. (I would avoid footage showing people, for they look like normal   people, while Berlin at that time scarcely resembles any city we know.) Once   the visual track is composed, I shall interview surviving Berliners about this   period, after the bombing but just before the arrival of the Allied forces.   Since these interviewees never appear on screen, here, as in the previous film,   authentic testimony can be gathered in any language that Berliners speak--German,   English, Russian, French, etc., and thus the film made wholly in those languages,   with a minimal of subtitling or overdubbing. In the course of making <i>A Berlin   Los</i>t, I heard several intervieweers speak of this period in images that   were not only stark but unfamiliar to me, testifying as they mostly did to human   ingenuity in the face of devastation; and when I saw the aeriel footage, I realized   that the combination of the two would make of this unique moment a film that   would not only echo its predecessor (in such stylistic characteristics as nonsync   sound) but would be valuable in itself. The film proposed here would probably   run between 20 and 40 minutes; ideally, in tours it would be shown with the   other. Since the moment portrayed was more than fifty years ago, it would be   good to do it soon. Sponsoring organizations wishing to know more about the   project should contact me at the above address. Thank you. </font> </p></body></html>
