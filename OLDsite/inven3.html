NTSC 3/4" U-Matic or NTSC VHS         1/2" cassettes can be supplied from, and should be returned to, the artist         at the above address. Fees are negotiable. All public performances should         be reported to ASCAP or its European affiliates. A single asterisk (*)         identifies tapes that have a hi-fi stereo soundtrack; those with a double         asterisk (**) would benefit from large-screen projection TV; those with         a triple asterisk (***) are also available in the historic 1/2" reel to         reel.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> The works fall into         distinct groups: (1) Tapes whose screen content is exclusively linguistic:         <b>Kinetic Writings</b> (1989, 22¹) consists of mute language realizations,         of both poems and fictions, that exploit capabilities unique to video.         <b>Video Strings</b> (*, 1989, 29:42) offers seemingly endless streams         of overlapping words, enhanced in different ways, with one example in         German. <b>Stringsieben</b> (1989, 12') has a different, more spectacular         continuous realization of the continuous German text. <b>Turfs/Grounds/Lawns</b>         (*, 1989, 23¹) has successions of four-word poems, eight-word poems and         sixteen-word poems, sometimes accompanied by aural realizations of the         same texts. <b>Partitions</b> (*, 1986, 27:40) offers long words in which         shorter words are embedded, in increasingly complex configurations. <b>Onomatopoeia</b>         (*, **, 1989, 23:00) displays on screen in increasingly complicated visual         arrays the text of RK¹s sampler-produced audio composition of words whose         sound represents their meaning. Two versions of <b>Kaddish</b> (*, 1991,         23:00) displays on screen a nonsynchonous English translation of the soundtrack         of the Hebrew prayer for the dead, spoken in various styles and accents         reflective the Diaspora.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> (2) Video fantasias         of audiotracks produced at sophisticated electronic music studios: <b>Invocations</b>         (**, 1988, 61¹), of arid about the sound of the language of prayer. [This         is available with six different openings: (a) English; (b) Latin; (c),         German; (d) Hebrew-Assyriac; (e) Italian-Yugoslav-Greek; (f) Swedish-Danish.]         The Gospels Abridged (*, **, 1988, 61¹) has parts of the four opening         books of the New Testament heard as a continuous fugue. Die Evangelien         (*, **, 1989, 58¹) is the same, wholly in German. Seductions (**, 1988,         25:30) has sixteen complimentary stories, interwoven one sentence at a         time, all spoken by RK, his voice amplified in various ways. <b>Relationships</b>         (**, 1988, 31:45) is an elaborate intimate memoir. <b>Two Erotic Videotapes</b>         (1988, 56:10) offers different video syntheses of the two preceding audiotapes.         <b>Two Sacred Texts</b> (**, 1988, 12¹) has differing video accompaniments         to two audiotapes: <i>Praying to the Lord </i>and<i> The Eight Nights         of Hanukah</i>. Eight different realizations to the former alone (*) are         also available towards an eight-monitor installation. The images in these         recent tapes were produced at the Experimental TV Center, Owego, NY, and         edited at Real Art Ways, Hartford, CT. <b>The Eight Nights Of Hanukah</b>         has that compositional alone, accompanied by computer-generated variations         on the Star of David.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 3.) Recent departures:         <b>Home Movies Reconsidered: My First Twenty-Seven Years</b> (1987, 46¹)         is an edited critical interpretaton of 8 mm film taken between 1937 and         1967. (Presently silent, it functions best as the basis of a live performance.)         <b>Americas¹ Game</b> (1988, 60¹) has representational imagery accompanying         a soundtrack of and about sounds, including language, unique to baseball.         4) Early works, mostly to texts that preceded involvement with video:         <b>Three Prose Pieces</b> (***, 1975, 20¹) has imagery indigenous to video,         as produced during a residency at Synapse, Syracuse University: (a) <b>Excelsior</b>         (1975, 1:05) switches rapidly between two voices and two shapes seducing         each other, the spoken words eroticizing the abstract imagery. (b) <b>Plateaux</b>         (1975, 3:55) relates the stases of a love affair in one-word paragraphs,         the screen showing an evolving moire pattern whose languid circularity         complements the circularity of the verbal narrative. (c) <b>Recyclings</b>         (1975, 14:05) is an incremental sequence of nonsyntactic prose texts (drawn         from a 1974 RK book of that title, reissued in 1984) that are read by         several nonsynchronous, identical voices (all RK¹s). The image consists         only of pairs of lips (likewise RK¹s), moving synchronously with audible         speech, the differences in hue indicating the age of the image. The first         section has one voice and one pair of lips; the last (and sixth) section         has six voices and six pairs of lips, each generation of lips-voices reading         the same nonsyntactic text nonsynchronously. <b>Openings & Closings</b>         (***, 1975, 56:10), also produced during the Synapse residency, draws         upon a book of that title, published in the same year, in which single-sentence         stories are alternately the openings and the closings of hypothetical         longer fictions. The author is seated in a chair reading the Openings         in color and the Closings in black-white, with each new image as different         as can be from the one(s) before, ideally realizing visually the leaps         in time and space that characterize the boosts text. <b>Literary Video</b>         (1977) has four bits of alternative literary recital: (a) A bearded mouth         reading the title piece, a 1976 manifesto about video is a propitious         medium for literary ideas (b/w, 5:¹45). (b) <b>Milestones in a Life</b>         (1977) with dark male eyes that hardly blink, while the soundtrack broadcasts         a story about a bourgeois life that is told in terms of numbers followed         by single-word paragraphs (b/w, 14:10). (c)<b> Dialogues </b>(1977) with         three, dramatically different exchanges of the words Yes and No, in which         only a hirsute Adam¹s apple is visible (b/w, :30, :35, :40). (d) <b>Plateaux</b>         (1977) with only the side of a face that is reciting a story whose single-word         paragraphs relate the evolution of an affair (b/w, 3:32). <b>Declaration         Of Independence</b> (1979, 9:20) has four pairs of superimposed bearded         lips, each visibly different in size, reading RK¹s contemporary "Declaration         of Independence," roughly simultaneously, from beginning to end. From         time to time an explanatory gloss, in capital letters larger than those         of televised movie subtitles, crawls along the bottom of the screen. <b>Epiphanies</b>         (1980, 31:00, b/w) nas single-sentence stories, produced entirely on a         character-generator, that are the epiphanies, which is to say resonant         moments that illuminate the entire (but here nonexistent) story. <b>Early         Literary Videotapes </b>is a single 120¹ NTSC VHS with copies of <i>Literary         Video</i>, T<i>hree Prose Pieces</i>, <i>Openings & Closings</i>, <i>Declaration         of Independence</i>, and <i>Epiphanies</i>. <b>Video Writing</b> (1987,         53:40) is an informal retrospective about this early work and the environment         behind its production, narrated by RK and directed by Robert Boynton Weyr.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Also available are         videotape copies of RK works originally produced in other media: <b>Epiphanies</b>         (1980, 44:20) documents the initial performance of the theatrical version         of the single-sentence texts mentioned before, now directed by Suzanne         Bennett with four readers at the University of North Dakota, March, 1980.<b>         Epiphanies</b> (1981, 48:45) documents a different performance, this with         several readers declaiming perhaps three times as many stories, directed         by E. St. John Villard at Vassar College, October, 1981. <b>Epiphanies         </b>(1982, 29:35) copies a film whose visual track contains clips of various         lengths that have this same epiphany quality. On the soundtrack are voices         reading stories that, typically, have no connection, other than similar         form, to the visual track. <b>Epiphanies</b> (1983, 19:50) copies a film         that no longer exists, broadcast over German television, with a wholly         German soundtrack and sections different from those in the English film         noted above. Broadcast rights for German-language television must be obtained         from SFB. <b>Five Versions Of Epiphanies</b> (1988, 32¹) has excerpts         from the four previous Œtapes, as well as the video version, mentioned         before, for character-generator. <b>Ein Verlorenes Berlin</b> (1983, 21¹)         copies an imaginative film documentary about Berlints Great Jewish Cemetery         as the principal surviving relic of "A Lost Berlin.¹ The visual track         has current scenes from the Cemetery; the soundtrack has the voices of         Berliners remembering, in German, the cemetery and its relation to the         Berlin they knew.<b> A Berlin Lost</b> (1985), which won a prize at the         Ann Arbor Film Festival (and later toured with it), has the same footage,         to the same length, now with ex-Berliners speaking English with different         testimony.<b> Ett Forlorat Berlin</b> (1984) has a soundtrack of Swedish-speaking         Berliners with yet other testimony. <b>Berlin Perdu</b> (1986) is the         same footage with a fresh French soundtrack. <b>El Berlin Perdido</b>         (1987) is Spanish; Berlin Sche-Einena Jother (1988) is Hebrew. Various         combinations of two Berlin films on 3/4" tape, or even more films on 1/2"         VHS tape, can be made for appropriate reasons. <b>Constructivist Fictions/Openings         & Closings </b>(198~4) copies two early b/w films of texts of RK books         with the same titles.
