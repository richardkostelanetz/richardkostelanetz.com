E. Cummings' classic   early retrospective of his own visual work, C.I.O.P.W. (1931), whose initials   identify successively charcoal, ink, oil, pencil, and water color, I thought   of doing a contemporary semblance, likewise entirely of images in large pages,   in my case titled P.V.F.H.I. (pronounced Fooey), implicitly echoing Cummings.   This new book would reproduce images of my work in print, video, film, holography,   and, soon, internet, now with only minimal text. In all media, it has been my   theme to produce in each medium what cannot be done in others.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"> While a book is an appropriate   medium for reproducing visual poetry and visual fictions that initially appeared   in print, the challenge here is discovering the best ways for reproducing in   a book's pages images, mostly of words, that initially appeared in time-based   media. Whereas Cummings had only one image to each large page, my book might   have several from a single source. Just as Cummings was the only prominent writer   of his generation to create enough visual images to fill a book, I'd like to   think that I have done as well, working, however, mostly in media that were   not available to Cummings nearly a century before. Implicitly, this proposed   book extends AnOther E. E. Cummings (1998) that I edited for Liveright and would   like to redo someday with the addition of a selection of Cummings¹ images.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"> Remember that individual   entries on RICHARD KOSTELANETZ appear in Contemporary Poets, Contemporary Novelists,   Postmodern Fiction, Baker¹s Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, A Reader¹s   Guide to Twentieth-Century Writers, the Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature,   Webster¹s Dictionary of American Authors, and Britannica.com, among other selective   directories.
