The first, <i>On Holography</i> (1978), is a revolving   cylinder containing five syntactically circular statements about holography   itself. One technical detail that makes this film hologram puzzling is that   the five lines appear to revolve in unison, even though they are of demonstrably   different lengths. By itself, <i>On Holography</i> has previously been exhibited   in group shows at New York¹s Museum of Holography and elsewhere; it was also   included in Richard Kostelanetz¹s traveling retrospective, <i>Wordsand</i> (1978-).   The cylinder is 16 l/2" in diameter, 9" high, and rests on a revolving stand   that is itself 17" high. Accompanying it is an audiotape of the same words in   continuous loops; but while this audio compliment can aid comprehension, it   need not be played constantly, if at all. The second hologram, <i>Antitheses</i>   (1985), is a two-sided framed glass, hung in space, 10" x 16" that contains   opposing fields of complementary words, one side suggesting warmth, the other   cold, with antithetical words in typographic pairs; and in each field, the words   fall into four planes projecting forward from the plate, optimally to points   two feet in front of the plate (itself a state-of-the-art achievement). Although   this pure hologram is ideally laser-viewable, it can be displayed successfully   with a halogen lamp, requiring at least ten feet of viewing space on each side;   it is presently installed in a structure of short poles, chains and plexiglas   mirrors that is easily transportable. In the late 1980s Kostelanetz produced   a series of simpler transmission holograms meant to be viewed from only one   side: <i>Ho/Log/Rap/Her</i>, <i>Ho/Log/Rap/Hy</i>, <i>Madam/Adam</i>, <i>Abracadabra</i>,   <i>Ambiguity</i>, <i>Hell/Elle</i>. <b>Literary Holography</b> will be a small   exhibition, easily installed, that would inhabit a darkened space of roughly   500 square feet. Possible sponsors (museums, galleries, libraries) seriously   wishing to consider photographs or slides of the two extant holograms, as well   as an extended 5,000-word essay about them, are advised to contact either the   artist at the address at the top of this page. Thank you. </font> </p></body></html>
