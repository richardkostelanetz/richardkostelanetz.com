A year-long workshop   in the <b>COMPLETION OF A BOOK</b>, which would include not only the writing   (or equivalent production) of a book-length manuscript but copy-editing, design,   and production, by any means available to the student, of a camera-ready dummy.   Since I believe that once you think in terms of doing a book, certain problems   are common, this course would be open to those wishing to produce book-length   manuscripts of poetry as well as fiction, visual books (of photographs or related   drawings) as well as nonfiction. Participants would make copies of works in   progress available to one another for continuous criticism and constructive   comment throughout the course of the year. (Now that I've produced some books,   I wish I had myself once taken such a course.)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 2.) A one-semester (preferably   spring) seminar in the production of <b>MAJOR ART PROJECTS</b>, open to practitioners   of all arts, where the requirement is simply the creation of major work representing   the sum of all the student has learned, plus intensive labor. The emphasis will   be on learning how to think like a professional artist, rather than mastering   the techniques of a discipline. I believe that though the various arts may differ,   the production of art involves common problems and that working alongside people   in arts other than your own has two advantages--an increase in general intelligence   about art and a decrease in feelings of specific competition. Students will   be asked to write critical commentary on all their colleagues during the course.   Readings and other research will be individually prescribed to suit the needs   of each student.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 3.) A one-semester (preferably   fall) seminar in <b>EXPERIMENTAL WRITING</b>, which would require students to   produce work with reference to literature that is radically unlike anything   they or I have seen before. This is designed to stretch imaginations, forcing   students to produce work well beyond what they have done, or thought they could   do, when they began the course. Readings will include anthologies edited by   me: <i>Imaged Words & Worded Images </i>(1970), <i>Future's Fictions</i> (1971),   <i>Breakthrough Fictioneers</i> (1973), <i>Essaying Essays </i>(1975), <i>Scenarios</i>   (1980), <i>Text-Sound Texts </i>(1980) and <i>The Avant-Garde Tradition in Literature   </i>(1982), which will function as catalogues of recent innovations that need   no longer be done.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 4.) A one-semester seminar   in the writing of <b>ARTS CRITICISM</b>, with an emphasis upon writing and thus   be open to critical aspirants of all arts. Different though the arts are, I   find that, once you become familiar with an art and develop esthetic principles,   the problems of writing criticism are fundamentally similar. Students will be   required to write different kinds of essays (monographs as well as reviews),   with different approaches (description as well as opinion), making copies for   one another to criticize, not only as editors but as colleagues; work will conclude   with each student writing an extended critical essay. Here too readings for   students will be recommended individually.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 5.) A one-semester seminar   in the <b>WRITE OF ARTING</b>, which would be for practitioners of all arts,   requiring esthetic self-definition through the writing of manifestoes, program   notes, autobiographical summaries, proposals, etc. Readings will include appropriate   writings of artists who have written about their own work with especial perspicacity:   John Cage, L. Moholy-Nagy, Ad Reinhardt, Paul Klee, Henry James, and Merce Cunningham,   with further selections designed to suit the individual ambitions of each student.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> These are meant to supplement   courses already given (rather than compete); no other university known to me   has them (and that nobody else could give them). None of them need a detailed   syllabus; all of them require a good deal of work. </font> </p></body></html>
