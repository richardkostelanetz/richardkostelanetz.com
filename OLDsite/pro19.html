Nothing   from the previous volumes will be included Among the recent essays I hope to   reprint are "1962-84," from G. J. Lischka's Alles und Noch Viel Mehr (1985);   "Audio Art in America: A Memoir," DLB Yearbook (Detroit: Gale, 1986); the review   of Russell Jacoby's The Last Intellectuals, American Book Review (1988); a memoir   of applying to the NEH, from The Journal of Unconventional History (1990); "Sephardic   Culture and I," from Home Planet News; "Chasing a Chair in the South," "Thoughts   on Being Canonized, Sort of," "Discovering Oneself on the Internet," "Editing   Book Anthologies" along with a recollection of a particular example; memoirs   of Brown and Columbia Universities; and eulogies of George Maciunas and Dick   Higgins. One departure will be reprinting Ray Gomez¹s brilliant essay on my   fiction. As before, one recurring theme of these essays is surviving as an independent   writer. All materials to be typeset can be delivered on discs ready for typesetting.   Any publisher interested in considering a preliminary manuscript should contact   me. Thank you. </font> </p></body></html>
