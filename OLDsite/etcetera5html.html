While <i>ABR</i> should   be pleased with such virulent responses, since some of us contributors feared   the journal was becoming a sleepy, inconsequential provincial university repository,   feel embarrassed, on the other hand, that only one (James Shivers) of the five   respondents seems intelligent, which means they're collectively batting .200.   Since one of the five plans, to <i>ABR</i>'s credit, to cancel his subscription,   consider raising your readers' average to .250, which is, alas, still well short   of big-league levels. Next time, remember that magazines having more respect   for their readership try to publish more thoughtful letters. (Think of Commentary,   American Scholar, The Nation, etc.) Indeed, some editorial wise-guys have purportedly   ghostwrote substantial letters to create the illusion of an intelligent audience.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> The most objectionable   sentences come from someone best left unnamed, because he is a friend who has   been a guest in my house, as I have been in his: "Publication is the least of   it: it should not have been written. It should not have been thought." Censorship,   pal, is authoritarian; thought-control is totalitarian. The first is unacceptable;   the second, indefensible. Precisely to combat both, I have served for many years   now on the Freedom-to-Write committee on American PEN.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> My friend finds me epitomizing   "the breakdown of literary community," even though I was exposing Charles Bernstein¹s   relentless factionalism, including his opportunistic erasure of colleagues.   (Indeed, some might say Bernstein has been more successful at splitting apart   the poetry community than writing poetry.)In misdirecting his animus, my sometime   pal incidentally reminds me of used car dealers who three decades ago were angry   at Ralph Nader rather than General Motors. If, on second thought, my sometime   pal meant to give me an excuse to repeat an obvious truth about Bernsteinian   tactics, thanks.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> Much as I respect James   Shivers¹ detailed reply, I should point out that he scarcely confronts the challenge   of remembering Bernstein¹s poems from a fresh position. Look at Bernstein¹s   own Home Page, and you¹ll notice that someone named Shivers is one of only six   authors listed as having published "About the Author." For that reason alone,   some editors might have disqualified his disingenuous letter from publication.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> Finally, if my former(?)   friend seriously thinks that political interpretations of literary moves "debases   our political, as well as our literary, coinage," would he please do everyone   the favor, please show more respect for his objection, by going after bigger   fish, beginning, of course, with Charles Bernstein. Consider, nonetheless, that   some of us might be more sensitive than others to essentially fascistic moves.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> As I¹ve exceeded by far   the space made available to me, know that longer replies by myself and others   will appear on the website richardkostelanez.com, where you are reading it now.   </font> </p></body></html>
