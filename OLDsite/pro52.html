Included on this single tape are ten major   works. Some of them are best viewed through two-part large-screen video projection   systems; most have hi-fi stereo soundtracks that are best heard not through   the single small speaker available on most television monitors but through stereo   amplification systems customarily using for playing records or compact discs.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 1) INVOCATIONS (1988)   has kinetic syntheses accompanying his audio composition of and about the sound   of the language of prayer.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 2) VIDEOSTRINGS (1989)   offers intrinsically endless streams of overlapping words, enhanced in different   ways, with one example in German, to the music of Gordon Jillson. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2">3) DIE EVANGELIEN (1989)   is an especially lush kinetic accompaniment to an audio fugue, in German, of   the four opening books of the New Testament.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 4) KINETIC WRITINGS (1989)   consists of mute language realizations exploiting capabilities unique to video.   </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2">5) SEDUCTIONS (1988) offers   abstract accompaniments to sixteen complementary stories, interwoven one sentence   at a time, all spoken by RK, his voice amplified in various ways.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2">6) TURFS (1989) has successions   of four‹word poems, eight‹word poems and sixteen‹word poems, sometimes accompanied   by aural realizations of the same texts. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2">7) AMERICAS¹ GAME (1988)   has representational imagery accompanying a soundtrack of and about sounds,   including language, unique to baseball. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2">8) STRINGTWO (1990) is   an extended stream of letters composed of overlapping words, each new one containing   at least two letters of its predecessor, so far silent. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2">9) PARTITIONS (1986) offers   long words in which shorter words are embedded, in increasingly complex configurations,   to the music of Gordon Jillson. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2">10) THREE PROSE PIECES   (1975) has pioneering video realizations accompanying RK¹s readings of three   experimental texts: Excelsior, Plateaux, Recyclings. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2">This video art was produced   during residencies at the Synapse, Syracuse, NY; Experimental TV Center, Owego,   NY; Real Art Ways, Hartford, CT, and Experimental Intermedia Foundation, New   York, NY, to audio tracks produced at the Electronic Music Studio of Stockholm   and Westdeutscher Rundfunk with the assistance of grants from the Media Arts   Program of the NEA and the DAAD Berliner Kunstlerprogramrn. For over two dozen   years now Richard Kostelanetz has been the only notable American writer producing   his own video art, which has been exhibited around the world. This Six-Hour   VHS Retrospective of Richard Kostelanetz¹s Video is available for rental or   purchase. If the former, it may be shown continuously, as a kind of marathon,   or divided into as many parts as the presenter wishes; it may also be made available   on loan, as in a library, for a predetermined duration. It may not be copied.   For further information, please contact the artist at the address at the top   of this page. Thank you. </font> </p></body></html>
