It will place Cage¹s poetry among his contemporaries and alsodistinguish poetry from his innovative prose (e.g., "145¹ for Speaker," "Mureau,"among others). The book can be any length that the publisher deems appropriate.Having received JC¹s verbal permission "to do whatever you wish," RK expectscooperation from the composer¹s estate. As we cannot discern in advancewhat might be available, at what prices, any table of contents is necessarily tentative.Once a contract is in hand, unforseen examples may arise. It would be possibleto make a substantial book without drawing upon material already published byWesleyan Univ. Press. May I recommend that this proposal not be submitted toany "poetry consultant" who will predictably proclaim that Cage¹s work is "not poetry.""Diary: 1965," from A Year from Monday (Wesleyan University, 1966), 18 pp.[This was previously reprinted in RK¹s Possibilities of Poetry (1970).]Illustrations of Not Wanting To Say Anything about Marcel (1969), along withhis explanation of compositional processes (Eye Editions, 1969), approx. 30 pp."Song" (Henmar Press, 1970)."36 Mesostics re and not re Marcel Duchamp," M (Wesleyan University, 1973), 8 pp."Empty Words, Parts I & IV," Empty Words (Wesleyan University, 1979), 20 + 13 pp."Writing for the Third Time through Finnegans Wake," previously unpublished, approx. 80 pp.Many of Cage¹s occasional mesostics, mostly written for particular occasions.Writings through Pound¹s Cantos, Unmuzzled OxWritings through the Bible, Chris Mann, etc.Writing through Allen Ginsberg¹s Howl, from Best Minds (Lospecchio, 1986), l0 pp.Selections from Themes and Variations (Station Hill, 1981fl, approx. 25 pp."Anarchy," from John Cage at Seventy-Five (Bucknell University, 1989), 60 pp."Scenario for M. F. [Morton Feldman]," "Stanzas for T. T. [Toro Takemitsu]," "Songs for C. W. [Christian Wolff]," all previously unpublished, copies of which I have.Selections from Mirage Verbal, "Writings through Mercel Duchamp, Notes," (1990), in French, 25 pp.A selection from recent texts, such as "Sonnekus," "Whiskus," and "Mirakus," some of which are reprinted in the booklet accompanying Joan La Barbara¹s CD (1990), most of which are, like much of Cage¹s writings from the 1980s, previously uncollected, if not unpublished. It would be appropriate to include the Erik Satie text, which has been publicly available for years via computer modem, though Northwestern Univ. Press once had a contract to make a book of it.
