The best magicians, musicians, stand-up         comedians, and even dance troupes all stop there, sometimes for extended         stays. So many acts are available in Las Vegas on any single night, at         such various levels of prominence ane expense, that the wealth of them         makes even New York City¹s rich offering seem slim. To give a sense of         this quanity, consider that in late May 1998, the last time I was there,         the venues were featuring Chuck Negro from Three Dog Night, Doug Sahm         & Last Real Texas Blues Band, Penn & Teller, Liza Minelli, Andrew "Dice"         Clay, Reba McEntire, Jerry Vale, "Jubilee" ("the stage spectacular featuring         the sinking of the Titanic"), Rosie O¹Donnell/Billy Porter, The Debbie         Reynolds Show, "Broadway . . . Off B¹Way!" ("a salute to New York¹s bigest         hit shows"), Al Jarreau, King Arthur¹s Phantom Boues Band, Kool & the         Gang with Sister Sledge, Eric Clapton, Wayne Newton, "EFX" ("a stage extravaganza         starring David Cassady and featuring more than 250 special effects"),         The Neville Brothers, Lance Burton: Master Magician, Siegfried & Roy (for         $89.50), Thunder from Down Under, "Showgirls of Magic," "the Best of the         Folies Bergere. . . Sexier than Ever," "Mystere" (from the great Cirque         de Soliel), among others. What I propose to do is a comprehensive and         yet selective appreciation of Las Vegas performance on all levels, with         examples both familiar and unfamiliar, focusing upon the best work. I¹d         start with the signage on the strip, which is incomparably rich and various         (making Times Square look minor league), and the street shows, such as         the fake volcano that erupts every fifteen minutes in the fountains before         the Mirage Hotel or the battle between masted ships every ninety minutes         before the Treasure Island Hotel. Simply walking from one hotel casino         to another, gawking at the extravagant interiors, is a theatrical experience.         My coverage would include the venues that performers have for one another,         such as the magicians¹ club that meets every Wednesday. I would expect         to identify emergent stars. During my last visit, I heard often of Danny         Gans, whose specialty is musical impersonations. While focusing upon acts         that are usually there, I wouldn¹t neglect those passing through. I would         also look into performers away from the casinos, such as the Las Vegas         Symphony and its modern dance troupe. The book should be "current¹ for         a decade. One significance of this development is that the casino gambling         corporations have become the principal patrons of the best performance         art in America (exceeding the arts councils on one hand and the television         networks on the other). In order to get people into the buildings that         also house casinos, their proprietors must give Americans kinds of live         performance unavailable on television. The best illustration is Cirque         de Soleil, a truly masterful ensemble that combines the circus tradition         with abstract dance, at a level that even the Medicis would have been         proud to sponsor. For this Canadian troupe, the Treasure Island Hotel         built a magnificent theater, seating fourteen hundred people without a         single pillar, for two shows every night. I heard during a my last visit         to Las Vegas that the new Bellagio Hotel, also owned by Steve Winn¹s Golden         Nugget Corp., will have a new comparable theater for a different Cirque         de Soleil program. (Another company tours the world, including stops in         New York.) I would collect illustrations from publicists and producers,         or the publisher could commission a photographer to make fresh pictures.         The text could be whatever length the publisher thinks most appropriate.         Editors interested in contracting this book should contact the author.         Thanks. </font></p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
