Highly literate essays from three decades.--<i>The Book   Reader</i> (March/April 1990)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Culled from more than   two decades of his writings on music, these highly readable essays [in <i>On   Innovative Music(ian)s</i>] reveal Kostelanetz as a critic of wide range and   eclectic taste. Consistent with his literary criticism, he is an advocate of   the new and experimental. His strongest work deals with the classical avant-garde.   One could not wish for a more understanding and articulate guide to the demanding   world of contemporary composition than Kostelanetz.--Lawrence Rungren, <i>Small   Press</i> (June 1990)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> This week, I would like   to talk about a writer who, more than any other I know, has managed to embrace   all that variety in its full complexity, from the blues of B. B. King to the   intricacies of the 12-tone system, from the profound simplicities of Alan Hovhaness   to the convolutions of Elliott Carter whose hard-core audience he defines quite   precisely as "that sophisticated and discriminating audience who finds Babbitt   too difficult and Cage too trivial." The writer I have been quoting is Richard   Kostelanetz, and a collection of his essays, On Innovative Music(ian)s has just   been published.--Joe McLellan, WETA-FM (Washington, DC, 11/20/1989)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> For stylish writing, one   turns to Richard Kostelanetz's hundred-and-umpteenth publication, <i>On Innovative   Music(ian)s</i>. . . . My favorite article is a jaundiced overview of writings   on contemporary music, ranging from The New Yorker to George Perle's theoretical   treatises, called "Music Criticism and the Literate Layman"; published in 1967   in <i>Perspectives of New Music</i>, it reads as though penned yesterday. .   . . Kostelanetz is best at evoking personal glimpses of shadowy figures: Alan   Hovhaness, Glenn Gould, P. D. Q. Bach's alter ego. Didn't you want to know that   Peter Schickele's ear-training course was Phil Glass's favorite course at Juilliard?   Kostelanetz always segues to a judgment, and in concentrated doses, his glinting   flakes of bravado snowball into presumptuousness. But his opinions are surgically   precise, so uncontaminated by generality that the offending ones are easy to   pick out. What remains is priceless.--Kyle Gann, <i>Village Voice</i> (October   9, 1990)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> The proposed book will   be divided into three sections, one about subjects, the other about individuals,   a third of interviews: For the first I have essays on Text-Sound Poetry, Twenty-Five   Years of Concerts, the radio plays of Glenn Gould, John Cage's work in German   radio, the music department of the National Endowment for the Arts, my own composition   Kaddish. The second will have have previously uncollected profiles of Arvo Part,   Lou Harrison, Nicolas Slonimsky, Peter Schickele, Alan Hovhaness, Bobby McFerrin.   The concluding section will reprint, from A Musical Quarterly, extended interviews   with both Lou Harrison and Nicolas Slonimsky. The other pieces originally appeared   in magazines such as <i>Boulevard</i>, <i>Journal of Musicology</i>, <i>Connoisseur</i>,   <i>The World & I</i>, <i>Precisely</i>, <i>Ear</i>. Publishers wishing to consider   a manuscript are invited to contact the author. Thank you. </font> </p></body></html>
