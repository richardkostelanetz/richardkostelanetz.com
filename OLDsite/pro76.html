All works are available on transcriptions, most of them scarce.   This series would open with Archibald MacLeish's <i>Fall of the City</i> (1937),   which remains a milestone to us all (and incidentally his greatest work in this   genre); but from there we would differ from other series that might likewise   start with MacLeish in concentrating upon the more radiophonic North American   works. By "radiophonic," I mean those pieces that successfully exploit the unique   possibilities of radio, to realize stories and experiences that could succeed   only on radio, my theme being that in this age of film and television radio   works best when it does what the other media cannot do--not when it attempts   to recreate the situation or even the illusion of live theater but when it realizes   experiences that can exist only in the ear. From the classic period, we will   play such works as Orson Welles's <i>War of the Worlds</i> (1938), Lucille Fletcher's   <i>Sorry, Wrong Numbe</i>r, Norman Corwin's <i>Daybreak,</i> and Kenneth Patchen's   <i>He Wears a Slouch Hat</i>. Since I have suggested elsewhere (most recently   in a program for Westdeutschen Rundfunk) that the great American radio theater   of the post-War years was in radio comedy, we will feature, for one program   apiece, several major figures from this period, including Amos 'n Andy, Jack   Benny, Fibber McGee and Molly, George Burns and Gracie Allen, The Easy Aces   and Fred Allen. Here we will play both whole programs and choice excerpts, depending   upon what is available, and how much commentary is necessary. The contemporary   (post-1950) period will include exceprts from Stan Freberg, Nicholas and May,   Cheech & Chong, John Cage's Roaratorio, the Firesign Theater's Do Anything You   Want To and selections from Bob & Ray, among others. The programs would be produced   by Richard Kostelnaetz, who will also write the brief commentaries. If the series   successfully develops a reputation, the whole cycle could be repeated; ideally,   it could also provide the sponsor with a foundation for fresh productions of   American audio theater. </font> </p></body></html>
