These sentences may then be published in any order, as long as the published   arrangement clarifies that the <b>Epiphanies</b> were not otherwise connected   to each other--say, with extra space between sentences, or separate paragraphs,   or blocks of type afloat in the space of the page. Publishers should consider   this an opportunity for innovative design and typesetting--for doing something   different not only from what they usually do but from what others have done.   The sentences in <b>Epiphanies</b> will also become the material of an audiotape,   a film, a videotape, and periodical publications, as well as a gallery installation.   The project is already acknowledged in histories and encyclopedias of American   fiction. Publishers wishing to consider a text over 50,000 words in length should   contact the author at the address at the top of this page. </font> </p></body></html>
