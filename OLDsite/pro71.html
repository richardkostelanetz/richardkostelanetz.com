I've so far taped Americans, a Bulgarian,   a Russian, two British women, a Dutchman, a Japanese, and a Texas woman who   lived for a while in Dublin. Samples of the openings of some of their declamations   are enclosed. I've have at various times approached Frenchmen, Hungarians, Swedes,   Germans, Rumanians, and Italians, among others, all of whom have agreed; but   since the project lacked a sponsor, I've refrained from wasting their time.   These declamations, reflecting various accents and declamatory styles, will   be interwoven into an aurally seamless rendition that will represent an international   acoustic interpretation of the <i>Wake</i>'s unique multilingual language. As   I now envision it, for most of the work's duration, only one or two of the many   readers will be audible at any time; they will fade it and out of one another.   At certain climaxes, many voices will join together. As Joyce himself recorded   part of this text, I expect to incorporate his declamation into the final mix   (and have received clearance from Folkways-Smithsonian, which produced the disc   here). It is hoped that participating radio stations around the world can be   induced to record their own best readers; Australia's ABC has already volunteered.   As the complete "Anna Livia Plurabelle" runs twenty pages in the book, this   <b>World-Around Wake</b> should take perhaps an hour. In the history of my own   work, this proposed piece descends from <i>Kaddish</i> (WDR, 1990), in which   people native to two dozen different languages (and accents) are heard reciting   the same Hebrew prayer, and <i>Invocations</i> (1981, 1984), which reveals through   sixty ministers speaking twenty-four languages the unique sound of words of   prayer. Like those earlier pieces of mine, this will use no sounds other than   human speech. In this proposed <i>Wake</i> I expect to discover what has not   been heard before--the international sound of a multilingual text whose aural   eloquence has universal, almost musical appeal. The result should be a classic   to be broadcast around the world and eventually put on disc. </font> </p></body></html>
