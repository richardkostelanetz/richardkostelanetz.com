The length of the book ultimately depends upon thepublisher's budget (with 320 pages as minimum), and the following selectionsare tentative, in part because all material will be reexamined and the adviceof colleagues solicited, especially about options that have recently appeared,but mostly because all possible contributors will be offered the following termsof payment: as two thirds of the publishers' entire advance to the editorbe allocated to the contributors upon publication, that sum will be dividedby the number of pages in the book to reach the basic per-page rate,with each contributor receiving this amount multiplied by the numberof printed pages of his or her selection, without exception. Those poemswhose authors/publishers cannot accept these equitable terms will simplybe listed in an appendix for readers to find on their own.ANDREWS, Lyman.
