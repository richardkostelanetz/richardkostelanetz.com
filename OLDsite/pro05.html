As the stories themeselves are         not intrinsically difficult, especially after their principle is understood,         the book should attract fiction-lovers willing to read a series of surprises         whose theme is the exhaustive experience of the experience of fiction.         My own design recommendation would be that 1001 Stories be published in         two editions--a 6" x 9" trade paperback and a 10 3/4" x 16 1/8" hardback,         photographically enlarged 180 % (so that the individual stories would         come to resemble newspaper headlines). Publishers should consider 1001         Stories an opportunity for innovative design and typesetting--for doing         producing a fiction package different from the common run. If the publisher         wishes, the author, also a noted book-artist, would be able to take charge         of the design and deliver camera-ready copy. A book both written and designed         by him was included in an annual exhibition of the American Institute         of Graphic Artists </font></p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
