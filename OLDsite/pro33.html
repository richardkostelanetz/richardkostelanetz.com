I would concentrateupon essays by Americans, mostly aboutAmerican literature, especially since, asfar as I can tell, Americans do this sort ofwriting more artfully than others. In choosingindividual essays, I¹ll observe two principles:first, effective examples of the art (and so willinclude demolitions of minor or forgotten figuresonly if those essays were artfully done, such asEdgar Allen Poe on Thomas Ward) and,second, covering all of American literature,thereby making this collection a counterweightto all the anthologies of laudatory remarks.Among my initial selections:Mark Twain, "Fennimore Cooper¹s Literary Offenses,"which has been frequently reprinted.Edgar Allen Poe, "Flaccus--Thomas Ward," "WilliamEllery Channing," "Simm¹s The Wigman and the Cabin,"all reprinted in Volume I of Edmund Wilson¹s Shockof Recognition.H. L. Mencken, "Dreiser¹s Style," reprinted in Volume IIof Edmund Wilson¹s Shock of Recognition; &amp; "Poetry in America,"Prejudices (Sixth Series) (Knopf, 1927).Edmund Wilson, "Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd&quot;[re crime mysteries], Literary Chronicle (DoubledayAnchor, n.d.).Stanley Edgar Hyman, "Edmund Wilson and Translationin Criticism," The Armed Vision (Knopf, 1948),which was excised from the paperback abridgment;"Bankrupt Treasuries" [re folklore scholarship], Kenyon Review (1958).Yvor Winters, "Spiritual Drifter [on Robert Frost],"On Modern Poets (Meridian, 1959).Eric Bentley, "American Drama (1944-54),&quot;Avon Book of Modern Writing No. 2 (1954)Dwight Macdonald, "By Cozzens Possessed" & "Updating the Bible," Against the American Grain(Random House, 1962).Leslie A. Fiedler, "Dead-End Werther: The Burn asAmerican Culture Hero," An End to Innocence (1955).Mary McCarthy, "Dry Ice [re Eugene O¹Neill]" & "StreetcarCalled Success [re Tennessee Williams]," Sights and Spectacles (1957).Randall Jarrell, "Anthologies," Poetry and the Age (New York, 1953).Edmund Fuller, "The Female Zombies," Man in Modern Fiction (Random House, 1959).John Simon, several selections from his criticism.Richard Kostelanetz, "A Magazine of Worse [on Poetry],"The Old Poetries and the New (University of Michigan, 1981);& "Joseph Brodsky," The New Poetries and Some Old (S. Illinois, 1991).Each selection should be prefaced by a headnote,just as the whole should have an introduction.I know from experience that once a book like thisis contracted and permissions are solicited,colleagues tell you about other appropriate possibilities.I think it would appeal to general readerswho have a taste for this sort of writing.The Art of Literary Demolitions should bewhatever length its publisher thinks feasible.As there is nothing like it, I expect that such a bookcould develop an aura and sell quite well over the years.</font></pre></body></html>
