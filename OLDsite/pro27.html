There remains in Berlin today another image   of lost Berlin, this less familiar than the others, but no less grand and compelling,   with a scale and detail that is more suitable to a reasonably priced book of   photographs. That relic is the Great Jewish Cemetery in Weissenssee, formerly   a rather inaccesible section of (East) Berlin. First established in 1880, it   differs from other Jewish cemeteries in its immense size (over 115,000 graves)   and its short history, which gives both first-hand and second-hand experience   of the place a epistemological coherence. Here are the gravestones of Jews who   lived in Berlin after 1860, when Berlin Jews received full civic equality, when   Jews, though never more than five per cent of the total city population, had   such a disproportionate prominence that, to the remainder of Germany, Berlin   was known as a Jewish city. Now that the notorious Wall has come down, The Week   in Germany reported in its edition of 8 November 1991, "Visiting Berlin's 164   cemeteries has become popular, and organizing such visits has become profitable   for others, according to the news magazine Der Spiegel. The Wiessensee Jewish   cemetery has been particularly hard hit; Manfred Alpern, supervisor of the cemetery,   described the wave of commercialism as 'like an amusement park.' He said that   he has come to work one recent Sunday morning to find a banner strung up between   two Trabant cars offering "Tours Through the Jewish Past." Even publications   on the cemeteries have taken on a new life: 10,000 copies of a book on the 100-year-old   cemetery in Stahnsdorf near Berlin were snapped up."</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> Choosing to regard this   graveyard as the principal surviving representation of a Lost Berlin, I shot   in the early 1980s a book of photographs, punctuated by short texts, designed   to be an exemplary visual history. These black-white photographs are set two   on a 6" by 9" page, except when a text supercedes a photograph. The book has   a brief preface and will conclude with explanatory footnotes correlated by page   numbers to certain individual photographs, adding essential information that   might not be apparent in the photographs alone. I also hope to obtain, for an   appendix, a complete list of all the individuals buried there, along with their   birthdates and deathdates (thinking that this would make the book essential   to the descendants of Berliners). All this prose notwithstanding, the unusual   presupposition of the book is that the photographs tell most of the story, for   in the gravestones we see not only individuals, whose lives are evoked in the   data and design of their unusually idiosyncratic stones, but an entire community   that, at least until the late l930s, clearly felt glad to be in Berlin, confident   that the city would remain secure for Jews forever. By contrast, the fewer stones   laid after l935 and then after l945 tell other sorts of stories.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> Thanks to support from   the Berlin Senat and then Inter Nationes, the German translation agency, a Berlin   colleague joined me in producing a set of six documentaries about the significance   of this extraordinary place--while the visual track is similar for all six,   the soundtracks have separately composed testimony of sometime Jewish Berliners   speaking German, English, Spanish, French, Swedish, and Hebrew. These films   have been screened at festivals and over public television. I also have several   hundred color transparencies that, sponsorship willing, could be exhibited in   a museum.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> My first-draft dummy of   book has over 250 pages. Publishers interested in considering a photocopy of   The Great Jewish Cemetery of Berlin, and promising a quick reply, are invited   to write me at the address at the top of this page. Thank you for your interest.   </font> </p></body></html>
