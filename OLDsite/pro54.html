If the   latter, the performer is asked to evoke by whatever means are available to his   or her instrument the content and style of that particular sentence. It is also   permissible to mix speaking and playing within the performance of a single sentence.   Singers may choose to sing the words to a melody of their own devising, or vocalize   the text, likewise to a melody of their own devising. Any number of performers   may participate; they may be distributed in any arrangement across the stage   or over the space. No conductor is required.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> As each sentence is completely   independent of all the others, they may be performed in any order, with or without   overlapping, with one limitation--no one shall perform two sentences in succession.   Performers should feel free to pick sentences from the text, selecting whatever   they find most appropriate to their instruments or their speech. Some line-interpretations   may be prerecorded on tape, making the speakers another instrument in the performance   (as long as the rule against two in succession is observed). Live-time electronic   transformation of performers' sounds is also permissible. Sentences not chosen   by the performers may be assigned to them by a group leader (or discarded).   Duration of both individual lines and the entire work may vary widely.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Once the performers established   an order, it might be convenient to number the sentences and then station at   the head of the ensemble a sequential counter, human or mechanical, that prompts   the performance of the next sentence. If the performers can develop alternate   interpretations for either the stories they have selected or those initially   assigned to others, the cycle of stories may be repeated within a single performance.   One purpose of considering Lovings as a musical score is seeing whether a strictly   verbal text can generate musical interpretations and thus exploring the relationship   between literary tone and musical tone.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> All performances should   be reported to ASCAP.
