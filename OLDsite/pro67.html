In the master I prepared on VHS/PCM,   it opens with <i>This Is My Poem</i>, a one-minute experiment in tape delay   in which a single phrase assumes wholly by itself (without any addition of instruments)   a musical resonance possible only on audiotape. Next comes <i>Excelsior</i>,   in which a single voice seduces itself in 1:20, and Milestones in a Life, in   which the annual stages in a bourgeois career become single-word events that   are subjected to increasing reverberation. <i>Praying to the Lord</i> (1977,   1981) was my most successful (and most rebroadcast) early work in which an English   prayer and then a Hebrew prayer were subject to canon-multitracking so that   a solo voice becomes an eight-voice canon, and then sixty-four voices, and finally   a resounding 512 voices, all within six minutes. <i>Carnival of the Animals</i>   (1988), produced on a sampler, is a self-chorus of many funny names for animals   (hippopotamus, grasshopper, etc.). <i>Ululation</i> (1992) is the first of a   projected series of acoustic fictions, which is to say narratives developed   through sound alone, in this case at once erotic and spiritual, for twenty‹six   minutes. <i>Kaddish</i> (1990, commissioned by Westdeutscher Rundfunk) tries   to discover in 23 minutes the acoustic of the Jewish disapora by presenting   different ways in which the Jewish prayer for the dead is spoken. <i>What¹s   in a Name</i> is a seven-minute series of witty explorations of the composer¹s   trochaic name. More than other works in this 80-minute collection, this last   is meant to be heard more than once and is thus ideally suited not for live   broadcast but for a medium that conveniently allows playback. Kostelanetz¹s   compositions are acknowledged in several histories of contemporary music; he   has also published many books of poetry, fiction, and criticism. Record producers   interested in auditing the works are advised to contact the composer at the   address at the top of this page. Please advise if you¹d prefer audiocassette   or VHS hifi. Thank you for your attention. </font> </p></body></html>
