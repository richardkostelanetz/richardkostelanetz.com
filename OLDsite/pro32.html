These would include not only essays and reviews   but letters and interviews, where relevant; it could also include imaginative   writings, such as poetry. These books should open with an appropriate introductions,   which can be a general biography or a more focused appreciation of the subject¹s   writing, and conclude with complete bibliographies of the subjectts writings.   For a publisher that initiated this series but was unable to produce it, I edited   Virgil Thomson and Dick Higgins edited Henry Cowell, either of which can be   provided as a sample. I began a comparable volume on Aaron Copland. B.H. Friedman   was approached to collect Morton Feldman, and I spoke Don Gillespie to do Lou   Harrison, Philip Ramey to gather Paul Bowles, and Chou Wenchung to edit Edgar   Varèse. I¹m aware of a Pauline Oliveros book that might belong here. Among those   major American figures worth publishing in this series would be Peter Schickele,   Anthony Braxton, Earle Brown, Ned Rorem, Christian Wolff, Stephen Sondheim,   Milton Babbitt, Leonard Bernstein, Steve Reich, Ruth Crawford (Seeger), and   Charles Wuorinen. Once the series becomes established, we might consider reprinting   other American composers¹ comparable books that are no longer in print or not   previously in paperback. One overarching theme is that the best American composers   articulate proficiently. Consider publishing the books in groups of two, perhaps   every six months, for at least two years, when we can measure whether it succeeded   or failed. Sales would gain from the books appearing in a series and from the   reputation of the publisher¹s music list. I¹d happily edit some of these myself   (recalling my work with John Cage, Nicolas Slonimsky, Gertrude Stein, L. Moholy-Nagy,   and E. E. Cummings, among others) and find others to do what they could do better   than I. </font> </p></body></html>
