Most, though not all,   have appeared in Richard Kostelanetz books; some were reprinted in anthologies   such as William Kilbourn¹s Canada: A Guide to the Peaceable Kingdom (Toronto:   Macmillan, 1970) and John McGreevy¹s Glenn Gould Variations (Toronto: Doubleday,   1973). Never before have they appeared between a single set of covers. Here   is my best record of the previous appearances of the essays:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> "The Glenn Gould Variations,"   Esquire (Nov., 1967), reprinted in the Kilbourn and McGreevy volumes noted above,   as well as my own Master Minds (New York: Macmillan, 1969) and On Innovative   Music(ian)s (Limelight, 1989). Review of Otto Friedrich¹s Gould biography, Liberty   (1990).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> "Understanding McLuhan   (In Part),tt New York Times Magazine (Jan 29, 1967), reprinted in several American   newspapers (thanks to NY Times syndication) and several textbooks, including   Ben B. Seligman¹s Molders of Modern Thought (Chicago: Quadrangle, 1970) and   Wilbert F. Moore¹s Technology and Social Change (Chicago: Quadrangle, 1972).   It appeared, abridged, as the cover story in Catholic Digest (July, 1967) and   in Spanish, Polish, Russian, and Serbian translations, mostly thanks to our   USIA. The definitive version appeared in my Master Minds. The second McLuhan   essay appeared intially in Twentieth Century (London, Autumn, 1966). It was   reprinted in the periodicals Commonweal (USA) and Revista de Occidente (Spain),   in addition to several anthologies including Bernard Bergonzits Innovations   (London: Macmillan, 1968) and Raymond Rosenthal¹s MeLuhan: Pro & Con (New York:   Funk & Wagnalls, 1968).

Illinois, 1991).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> I¹m open to suggestions   for making these into a book. </font> </p></body></html>
