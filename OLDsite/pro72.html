The introduction would identify characteristics of "The American Imagination" that makes American art generally different from European. The secondary theme is that these individuals and activities constitute the American canon and that knowledge of their achievements is essential literacy. The entries would be generally appreciative and at once introductory and scholarly, as we¹ve done before, concluding with short bibliography of both primary and secondary references. While this reference book is destined ultimately for libraries, we hope that the writing would be clean enough for the text to become a trade book, probably without the documentation, perhaps with a book club. Consider three lengths: 10,000 words apiece for subjects marked A; 5,000 words apiece for subjects marked B; 2,000 words apiece for subjects marked C. Since I did my graduate work in American history on artists in America, I have thought about these individuals for over three decades, I expect to write much of this book myself, sometimes in collaboration for Tony Coulter and Doug Puchowski, both of whom worked with me on the revised edition of my <i>Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes</i> (1999). Those subjects that others can do better would be assigned by me and delivered to me, who has edited anthologies of fresh criticism before. Names of possible contributors appear below after the letters designating projected length. (RK is myself.) Though individuals and subjects will be treated alphabetically, the book should also have chronological timelines. One departure is that all names mentioned in the book,but not given an individual entry, will receive at least two lines of identification is a biographical index, mostly by Douglas Puchowski.  Among the artists deserving individual entries, consider the following:Adams, Ansel, a major photographer: C, A.
