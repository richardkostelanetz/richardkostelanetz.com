Its thesis was that only in   the post-War period did American thinking in many fields achieve first-rank   importance and major international influence. My strategy in writing this book   was not to prove this thesis, which he took to be virtually self-evident to   those who knew (and cared), but to identify and summarize what this major thinking   was. I completed several chapters before putting the project aside to complete   something else; it was never resumed. The chapters finished beyond the introduction   covered "Historiography," "Sociology," "Social Philosophy," "Govern|ment," "Anthropology,"   "Esthetics," "Architecture," "Literary Criticism," "Theater," "Fiction," "Poetry."   Some of them have appeared in such U.S. cultural periodicals as Bennington Review,   Sun & Moon, Western Humanities Review, and Boston University Journal; some were   even reprinted in books. Since most of these essays are not conveniently available,   while readers of one often ask about the others and, most important, no other   comprehensive book on post-WWII American thought has since appeared, may I propose   that these chapters now appear as a single volume sub-titled "An Unfinished   History." Since many other books of mine have appeared since this was drafted,   there are advantages to publishing it now. </font> </p></body></html>
