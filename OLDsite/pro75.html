In these pieces,   I have tried to introduce first-rank intellectual and artistic achievements   in terms comprehensible to laymen and then to show how such work reflects its   authors. Since cultural achievement is the source of my interest, these profiles   are mostly sympathetic, though scarcely uncritical. People familiar with my   writing tend to judge them as my most popular (or incipiently popular) prose.   Nonetheless, when <b>Master Minds</b> first appeared in 1969, its publisher   was administratively disintegrating; and even though the book was scarcely advertised   and never reprinted, it was kept in print for a dozen years before its copyright   was returned to me. In the meantime I have done similarly extended profiles   of other seminal figures, including Kenneth Burke, Edwin Land (the Polaroid   chief), Noam Chomsky, Northrop Frye, Robert Wilson, Hannah Arendt, Merce Cunningham,   John Ashbery, and B. B. King, among others. What I propose now is a new edition   of <b>Master Minds</b> that would include these new pieces, revised for their   inclusion here. (If these can be set in type identical to that of the original   book, the earlier chapters need not be reset.) I would like to think that this   new Master Minds not only would attract literate general readers; especially   in paperback, it would also be used in courses devoted to intellectual history   and contemporary studies. Any editor seriously wishing to consider the original   volume, along with the new pieces, is advised to contact me please at the address   at the top of this page. Thank you. </font> </p></body></html>
