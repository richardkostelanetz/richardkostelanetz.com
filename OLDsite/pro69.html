The middle programs with be devoted   to the classic recordings, one program apiece, of that generation that became   prominent between the Wars--T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound (favoring the extraordinary   l938 recordings made at Harvard), Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams,   Carl Sandburg, Vachel Lindsay and Ogden Nash. Here we would endeavor to select   the best poems and best renditions from the available sources, both public and   private. At that point, perhaps fifteen programs down, the series will turn   from documentations of poets' performances to their more intimate and exploratory   involvement with recording and broadcasting technologies. We will start with   the classic poets' radio plays--Archibald MacLeish's Fall of the City, Stephen   Vincent Benet's John Brown's Body, and Kenneth Patchen's He Wears a Slouch Hat.   The remaining few programs will concentrate upon post-war poets' direct involvement   with audio technologies--to make with microphones, amplifiers, mixing boards,   audiotape, samplers, and other devices what cannot made done live. Among the   poets featured here will be John Giorno, Jerome Rothenberg, Charles Amirkhanian,   Dick Higgins, Raymond Federman, Norman Henry Pritchard, and Judith Johnson Sherwin.   These programs will be edited, written and narrated by Richard Kostelanetz and   Paul Kresh who, since they have different tastes and interests, will divide   the whole series in the following way: Both will be responsible for the opening   programs, Kresh will be particularly responsible for the classic period, so   to speak, while Kostelanetz will be in charge of the last section. Both have   written extensively about American poetry and poets' recordings. Kostelanetz,   in addition, organized <i>American Writing Today</i> for Voice of America, while   Kresh has worked as a producer for both Caedmon and Spoken Arts, personally   producing l00 American Poets for the later label. </font> </p></body></html>
