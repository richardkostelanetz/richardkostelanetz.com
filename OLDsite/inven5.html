Based upon a shorter feature initially produced         for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, this 91:00 program divides         evenly into two equal parts. It supercedes an earlier self-feature, <b>Audio         Art</b> (1978), that was likewise produced for Australian Broadcasting         and covers just earlier works, interspered between general statements         of principle. 45:00.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Portrait of New         York City Radio</b> (1985) was initially produced for Klaus Lindemann         of the features department of Sender Freies Berlin. Comprehensively regarding         NYC radio from the European point of view, it notices first the abundance         of stations audible in a panoramic survey of the dial, and then the absence         of a published complete radio schedule, in order to define how New York         radio culture (and, by extension, American) differs from European. The         bits of commentary separate a few dozen acoustic examples. I produced         at home a rough tape, 70:00, not only to introduce my analysis but to         function as a guide to stations producing the feature in languages other         than English.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Hörspiel USA:         Radio-Comedy</b> (1983) suggests that the great tradition of American         radio theater consists not of literary dramas, in the European mold, but         something scarcely known on the Continent--radio comedy. The excerpts         from the classic period (1929-52) were chosen not only to be comprehensible         to a foreign audience but to emphasize the historical discovery of the         unique theatrical possibilities of radio (as neither live stage nor film).         Among the American radio artists quoted are Jack Benny, Fibber McGee and         Molly, Jack Pearl, Amos 'n Andy, Abbott & Costello, and Peter Schickele.         This was commissioned by Klaus Schoning of the horspiel department of         Westdeutscher Rundfunk; the text was transated into German by Deborah         Kagel. It was rebroadcast by WDR as recently as 2000. This feature was         reproduced in Swedish by Sveriges Radio early in 1984. 45:00. I recently         rewrote the script to add critical depth and plan to produce soon of this         new text a rough tape approximately 70 minutes long.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Komische Horspiel         Made in America Heute</b> (1985) is a sequel also made for WDR- Horspiel.         Its thesis is that since the mid-1950s, when television superceded radio         as the principal medium of mass communications in America, the best native         audio comedy has appeared first not on radio but on records, to be reproduced         on radio in contexts outside the artist's control. After an extended introduction         to the crucial career of Stan Freberg, the program quotes examples from         Mike Nichols & Elaine May, Gilda Radner, Peter Schickele, The First Family         and Charles Dodge. I prepared a rough English version 53 minutes long;         the German program ran about 50 minutes.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Glenn Gould as         a Radio Artist</b> (Horspielmacher) (1984) is a critical introduction         to the "docudramas" of the Canadian musician Glenn Gould. As documentaries         that draw heavily upon the potentialities of multitrack audiotape, as         well as the liberties and devices of fiction, they are perhaps the best         Audio Art ever done in North America. My commentary focuses on two trilogies         of hour-long pieces--one trio about isolation in Canada, the other about         three musicians (Schonberg, Stokowski, Richard Strauss)--and on Gould's         use in his radio art of the tape-editing techniques he also used in producing         records of his music performances. One theme is that even though these         radio pieces contain no notes or words of his own invention, they represent         the "composition" he always wanted to do. This feature, which quotes works         not publicly available, was also commissioned by the WDR-Hörspiel which         first broadcast it in June, 1984. 70:00. I prepared a rough English version         that is 63:00.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Text-Sound in         North America</b> (1981) is an introductory survey to American language         art that coheres more in terms of sound than syntax or semantics. The         commentary includes sketches of each participating artist and his or her         work: Beth Anderson, "If I Were a Poet"; Charles Amirkhanian, "Church         Car"; Bliem Kern, "Jealousy"; Charlie Morrow, "Sunchant"; Norman Henry         Pritchard, II, "Gyre's Galax"; Toby Lurie, "Innocence"; Jerome Rothenberg,         "Tenth Horse Song"; Charles Amirkhanian, "Roussier" (not Rouffier)"; Glenn         Gould, prologue to The Idea of North; Jim Theobald, "Nasoplosive Chant";         Richard Kostelanetz, "Praying to the Lord"; Charles Dodge, "The Days of         Our Lives"; Tom Johnson, "GBDA"; and Jackson Mac Low, "The First Milarepa         Gatha." This was originally produced for the Australian Broadcasting Commission,         which rebroadcast it in 1983. 61:40.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Amerikanische         Klangtexte</b> (1983) is an abridgement of the above feature, commissioned         by the Literatur department of Sender Freies Berlin and translated into         German by Martin Koerber. Examples here include Beth Anderson, Bliem Kern,         Norman Henry Pritchard, II, Charlie Morrow, Toby Lurie, Jerome Rothenberg,         Charles Amirkhanian, Steve Reich, Charles Dodge, and Tom Johnson. 30:00.         (Another shorter version was prepared for translation into Italian by         RAI and broadcast in 1983 as a program several minutes long, with excerpts         from only Beth Anderson, Jerome Rothenberg, and Charles Dodge.)</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Hörliterature</b>         (1983) is another introductory survey of my art on audiotape, commissioned         by Sender Freies Berlin and translated into German by Martin Koerber.         Here the examples were chosen to favor work that could be understood by         an audience that does not normally hear English, and one theme of the         program is the progress from work initially done in English to other languages,         including German. Thus, the examples, in sequence, are "This Is My Poem,"         "Alphabet," "Excelsior," "Milestones in a Life," "Praying to the Lord"         (which is in both English and Hebrew), an excerpt from Invocations (which         is in two dozen languages) and "Stringsieben," a text of overlapping German         words which is spoken here by the performer who commissioned it, Eberhard         Blum. 30:00.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Nach Weissensee</b>         (1984) is a composition of German Jews talking about pre-War Berlin. Their         comments are prompted by recollections of the great Jewish cemetery there         (Weissensee), which survives as the principal surviving relic of pre-War         life there. This radio program expands upon the themes of a film Ein Verlorenes         Berlin (1984), and was produced with Martin Koerber and Michael Maassen         for RIAS in Berlin. 65:00. To redo the film in English, French and Swedish,         we did not use sub-titles or artificial overdubbing but composed a wholly         new soundtrack from fresh interviews with ex-Berliners speaking those         other languages, and thus could thus similarly reproduce the general structure         and themes of our radio feature in those languages. With sufficient support         for fresh interviews, we could also reproduce our radio feature in Dutch         and Hebrew.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>A Special Time</b>         is a 60-minute extended montage of voices and sounds (commissioned by         American Public Radio) towards a multi-part series about the 1960s. Interviews         about Radio and Audio Art: Charles Dodge and Doris Hays, each 29:00, initially         produced for Australian Broadcasting; Rudolf Arnheim, about his <i>Radio:         An Art of Sound</i> (1937), separately, in English, approx. 60:00, and         German, approx. 50:00 (commissioned by WDR-Hörpsiel); and John Cage, about         his work in, with and for radio., approx. 100:00 unedited. Other features         in progress include "The Voices of American Writing," an "Audioautobiography."</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> If any producers         wish to audit cassette copies, consider scripts for translation into other         languages, inquire about fees and ask any other questions, please write         me at P.O.
