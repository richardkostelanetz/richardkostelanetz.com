Otherwise, the         chapters will be drawn from talks initially done as features for European         radio, some of which have appeared in print here in literary magazines:</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 1.) The American         Tradition of Radio Drama, which suggests that in contrast to Europe our         best radio theater is vernacular (e.g., radio comedy)</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 2.) Audio Comedy         in America Today, which argues that since 1952 the best radio art, including         comedy, appeared first on lp records</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2">3.) New York City         Radio, which explains narrow-casting and appreciates variety</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 4.,) Glenn Gould         as a Radio Artist, which introduces the compositions of speech and sound         that the great Canadian pianist produced from 1967 to his early death</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 5) John Cage as         Hörspielrnacher, which traces his work with audiotapes and radio from         Williams Mix through the famous Roaratorio</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 6) American Sounds         in Germany, which introduces the extraordinary, and extraordinarily successful,         radio produced by Americans working in the 1980s for German stations</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 7) Tony Schwartz         and One-Minute Audio Art, which elaborates the thesis, mentioned elsewhere,         that the best art produced nowadays for radio, rather than radio, appears         in abbreviated forms (i.e., commercials)</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> 8) The funding of         quality radio in America, which explained to Europeans how radio art is         produced here by stations lacking funds.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> The essays appeared         here in magazines ranging from the <i>New York Times</i> to <i>North American         Review</i>.
