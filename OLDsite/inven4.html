One includes many         short pieces, beginning all those mentioned above, aside from Invocations         and the self-retrospectives, in addition to a few others <i>(What's in         a Name</i>, <i>Turfs & Grounds</i>, and binaural, bilingual renditions         of Rimbaud's <i>Le Bateau Ivre</i>). Two includes New York City , <i>The         Gospels </i>and <i>Die Evangelie</i>n, all originally commissioned by         European radio. Three includes all six versions of Invocations in sequence         (see above). Four includes four hours of <i>Epiphanies</i> in English,         followed by 45 minutes in German and then several minutes in Chinese and         then Vietnamese, all prefaced by <i>Openings & Closings</i>. All pieces         on these tapes were mastered from the reel to reel originals in hi-fi         VHS stereo, which reportedly has less tape noise than audiocassette and         even the best reel to reel. Each tape is six hours long. These are thus         idea for those audiophiles who have incorporated VHS into their hi-fi         systems, and as these "videotapes" contain only audio they may be played         on European PAL transducers as feasibly as on American NTSC. First edition.         $150.00 apiece; $500.00 for the entire set. Another set, at similar prices,         comes in the superior, but less common 14-bit digital format of PCM-VHS.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> If you have any         questions, don't hesitate to ask. </font></p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
