In this subtle visual history,   the Cemetery and its evocative gravestones become an archaeological window into   a Berlin that, alas, no longer exists. On the soundtrack is the authentic testimony,   in either English, German, French, Spanish, Swedish or Hebrew, of ex-Berliners   remembering the Cemetery and the world represented there. A Berlin Lost, Ein   verlorenes Berlin, Berlin Perdu, El Berlin Perdido, Ett Forlorat Berlin, Berlin   Sche-Einena Jother--these films have been shown at festivals at Berlin, Munich,   Oberhausen, Edinburgh, Melbourne, Jerusalem; the English film won a prize at   the Ann Arbor Film Festival and toured with it. Since the gravestones on the   film's visual track already provide so much to read, we chose not to sub-title   the footage (or allow the affectations associated with overdubbing), but, instead,   to reproduce the footage with wholly new sound tracks composed from fresh interviews   with ex-Berliners speaking those six languages. Not only because the soundtracks   differ in content, but also because the imagery begs to be reseen, our recommendation   is that at least two, preferably three, versions ideally be seen in sequence.   (For each version, we can provide printed translations of its soundtrack into   English.) We have also joined Michael Maassen in producing, from the German   interviews, a 65-minute radio feature <i>Nach Weissensee</i> that has been broadcast   over German stations and favorably reviewed in the German press. We think A   Berlin Lost would especially interest ex-Berliners and their descendants, many   of whom know about the Cemetery but have never seen it (in part because it is   now in East Berlin), as well as those generally interested in European Jewish   culture and the life of great cities. Either of us can accompany the film(s),   answering questions about it and Weissensee today. 16mm copies of the films   can be loaned gratis from the nearest Goethe House. Institutions interested   in screening our work(s), in sponsoring our accompanying presentations or in   auditing 3/4" U-Matic or 1/2" VHS videotapes should write or call either of   us at the addresses at the top of this page. Thanks. </font> </p></body></html>
