Between 1970 and1982, Assembling Press published thirteenworld-famous annuals of "otherwiseunpublishable" (aka avant-garde) art andliterature, <b>Assemblings</b>. Instead of selectingfrom submissions presented to it, RichardKostelanetz (and, at various times, HenryJames Korn, Mike Metz, Scott Helmes,and David Cole) invited potential contributorsto submit a thousand copies of whateverthey wanted to include, and these feastyfestivals of visual and verbal waywardnesswere alphabetically assembled into 8 1/2" by 11" books. Evaluating these alternate activities,the American poet and critic Karl Young wrote in the critical magazine <i>Margins</i>, "In 1917 Ezra Pound hoped to edit magazines as whole entities--having the kind of completeness, formal integrity, structure and continuity you find in a good novel. Since [Pound's] <i>The Exile</i> we have had--as far as I know--only one gut innovation in magazine editing technique. That came in 1970 with the founding of Assembling."Assembling Press has also issued books ofpoetry, fiction and criticism and other relatedexperimental works in several media. Thesepublications have been reviewed, exhibited,and distributed around the work. In October,1978, all of Assembling Press's works weredisplayed at the the Pratt Graphics Centerin New York City; it was, as far as anyone cantell, the first time since the <i>Dial</i> that a smallAmerican literary press was honored with aninstitutional retrospective.Among the Assembling Press publications nowavailable through Archae Editions are:<b>Assembling</b> (1970), 162 pp., the opening salvo, $20.00)<b>Second Assembling</b> (1971), 180 pp., $18.00(with a Stan VanDerBeek fold up only available in a few copies, $50.00)<b>Third Assembling</b> (1972), 280 pp., $30.00<b>Fourth Assembling</b> (1973), 274 pp., o.p.<b>Fifth Assembling</b> (1974), 284 pp., $18.00<b>Sixth Assembling</b> (1975), 288 pp., $18.00<b>Seventh Assembling</b> (1977), 396 pp., $26.00<b>Eighth Assembling, A-J</b>, (1978), $30.00<b>Eighth Assembling, K-Z</b>, (1978), $10.00 (toserve an increased number of contributors,the Eighth number appeared as two volumes,alphabetically divided, the first becomingmysteriously scarcer than the other)<b>A Critical (Ninth) Assembling</b> (1979), anassembling of camera-ready criticalcommentary on experimental literature aroundthe world, $15.00<b>Tenth Assembling</b> (1980), produced with theSt. Paul visual poet Scott Helmes, $15.00Eleventh Assembling: Pilot Proposals (1981),"If you could apply for a grant of $500,000,what precisely would you propose to do?"$10.00<b>Assembling Assembling</b> (1978), aretrospective produced on the occasion of ourretrospective exhibition, 96 pp., $10.00<b>Complete Assembling</b> (1970-82), approx.3,000 pages, collecting the first thirteenvolumes (except Fourth, which has apparentlydisappeared), $250.00.
