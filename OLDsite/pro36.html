In contrast to, say,   Jerome Rothenberg¹s America a Prophecy (Random House, 1973), which collects   the prophetic tradition, or The New Oxford Book of American Verse (1976), which   pretends to reprint everybody important, or The Treasury of American Poetry   (Doubleday, 1978), which is an incoherent compendium, The American Tradition   of Poetry would focuse upon those native works which realize technical invention   in the history of poetry. It is my thesis that the principal American tradition   in poetry, as in music and in painting, is one of formal invention in the machinery   of the art--a tradition of doing technically what had not been done before,   either in Europe or here. Therefore, The American Tradition of Poetry will emphasize   the more inventive poems of John Wilson, John Fiske, Edgar Allen Poe, Walt Whitman,   Gertrude Stein, Vachel Lindsay, E.E. Cummings, Langston Hughes, Eugene Jolas,   Melvin Tolson, Bob Brown, Charles Olson, Jack Kerouac, John Ashbery, John Cage,   Jackson Mac Low, as well as those contemporaries extending this indigenous tradition--in   sum, a succession of selections that will, like innovative art itself, surprise   as it persuades. The American Tradition of Poetry will also contain a substantial   introduction similar to those in other anthologies of mine; this new essay will   develop ideas initially presented in critical essays collected in my book The   Old Poetries and the New (Univ. of Michigan, 1980). Because the theme of this   proposed anthology is so particular, I expect that it will be considerably shorter   than the competing anthologies of American poetry (and thus more reasonably   priced, especially in paperback) and that it will be particularly successful   with students of American literature, not only as the principal book in more   advanced courses, but also as an alternate selection in the standard surveys   (because it collects poems that are not in the other anthologies). The American   Tradition in Poetry could be delivered within a year of contracture. If interested,   please contact me. Thank you. </font> </p></body></html>
