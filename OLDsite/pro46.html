Box 444, Prince Street New York, NY 10012-0008, rkostelanetz@bigfoot.comPROPOSAL for an anthology of Classic Essays On Rock Music:Edited, with introductions & headnotes, by Richard Kostelanetz and AnotherFilling a need, this should be rich enough to stand besidesmy earlier coedited anthology of Classic Essays on 20th CenturyMusic. It should differ from, say, the Rolling Stone compilations,which I gather sell quite well, in drawing from more than one sourceand in favoring more substantial, longer (bookish) essays with moremusicological intelligence, often including musical examples (whichdon't appear in the Rolling Stone books). It could be used as eithera primary or supplementary text in courses devoted exclusively tovernacular music. It would also attract general readers, especially ifits design resembles that of the other Classic Essays volume. It canbe whatever length the publisher deems appropriate, with aminimum of 100,000 words. My own suggestion is that we want toundercut the Rolling Stones books, which are made needlesslyexpensive by the photographs, which are not necessary here.(Doesn't everyone one what the Beatles look like?)  Among the essays I would like to include are Stanley EdgarHyman's classic on the Blues as the principal precursor of rock(from an Atheneum book)Langdon Winner's "The Strange Death of Rock and Roll," fromGriel Marcus' Rock and Roll Will Stand (Beacon, 1969)Edward Machan's "The Spirit of Albion," which relates heavy metalmusic to British traditions including Vaughan-Williams; it wascleared for an earlier anthology but not used because ofpermissions problemsBrian Eno's "Generating and Organizing Variety in the Arts," fromStudio International (Nov-Dec. 1976), which we likewise cleared for20th Century Music but not used thereNed Rorem's "The Music of the Beatles," from The New YorkReview (1968)Wilfrid Mellers' appreciation of Imagine, which is reprinted inThe Lennon Companion (Schirmer, 1987)Lenny Kaye's "The Best of Acappella," from Jazz and PopMagazine (1969)Dan Graham's "New Wave Rock and the Feminine," in whicha prominent visual artist appreciates women's groups in 1970sTom Wolfe's "The First Tycoon of Teen," about Phil Spector,from Kandy Kolored (1965)Charles Hamm's "Rock 'n' Roll in a Very Strange Society," in whicha Dartmouth musicologist deals with South African popular musicMy own appreciation of the Joshua Light Show from Fillmore East(Schirmer, 1995).  Remember that these selections are necessarily tentative.Much depends upon such practical considerations as theavailability of individual essays and the size of both the permissionsbudget and the book; in certain cases, I know of appropriatealternatives, some of which are included in the following list.I expect to remain open to suggestions from others for alternativeswithin our overall designs. All are currently in English. Since this isa book meant to last at least a decade, unlike a journal article thatsurvives only until the next issue, these selections should eschewcurrently fashionable subjects and jargons. One editorial rule isthat every inclusion must be readable. Should anyone have anyadditional questions, fire away.</font></pre></body></html>
