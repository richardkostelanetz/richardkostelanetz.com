Since most of my creative work has been literary,   the people awarding me this grant no doubt expected that I would come up with   proposals for public art different from the common run. Well, I have. One principal   way in which they differ is that most are for extended spaces, such as the edge   of a train platform, a series of vaults in a hallway ceiling, the vertical risers   of a wide flight of steps, or the floor of a very long passageway, such as that   connecting one train line to another or the airline terminal to the departure   pad. Although I can submit slides of certain work I have done, some of which   incorporate kinds of images that might fill such spaces, please consider these   less relevant than my declaring first my preference for such spaces (which most   other artists inclined to public art finds impossible) and then that I work   within a literary tradition--with language and/or literary forms.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> For the edges of train   platforms, for instance, I am proposing the installation, in brass letters at   least 4" high, two feet from the edge, their bottoms facing away from the tracks,   of texts I call strings. These texts are extended sequences of letters that   are composed of overlapping words, each new word including at least three letters   of its predecessor. Let me quote, as an example, the beginning of <i>Stringfive</i>:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Stringfiveteranciderideafencerebrumblendivestablishmentertainteger|unde   rwritemperamentorthographysicisternumericalibereavesdrpenervous....</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> I calculate that, if the   letters are 4" high and set lower-case, an exhaustive text (that is 100" on   my typewriter) would be 200 feet long, which happens to be the length of a typical   subway-train station. Since, unlike most public art nowadays, these strings   cannot be assimilated in a single glance, they need, to be frank, a captive   audience, like one waiting impatiently for a train, willing to work on a puzzle,   with full assurance that should they not entirely solve it now, it will surely   be there the next time they return.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> For extended passageways   and ceilings, like the interior of an arcade, I have works I call constructivist   fictions which are sequences of square symmetrical abstract line drawings that   metamorphose in some sort of systemic narrative and, in contrast to verbal fiction,   can be "read" from either end. Some involve only a few successive drawings;   others fall in the range of nineteen images (and are thus suitable for spaces   extended to the ratio of nineteen to one); one is nearly four hundred images   long (and thus perfect for the driveway to the CIA!). One of these was a finalist   three years ago in a competition for a hallway ceiling in the Portland Justice   Center.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> A final proposal I have   is for a film installation of <i>Epiphanies</i> ideally in a place where people   are waiting against their wishes. Now that I have written this letter, as well   as the enclosed proposal, could I please ask you to show both, which may be   freely copied, in addition to several slides (enclosed), the next time your   panel meets to consider artists' ideas for art in public spaces.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Naturally, if I pass the   first hurdle, I would be willing to make more specific models for more specific   sites. If you or your colleagues have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.   Thank you for your continuing interest. </font> </p></body></html>
