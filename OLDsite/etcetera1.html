(Remember that it would cost at least $20,000 to make 16 mm. archival   prints of these films.)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> 7) Copies of visual art,   including limited editions, prints, and drawings not currently exhibited.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> 8) Professional correspondence,   customarily sorted biannually in alphabetical files. Starting in the mid-1980s,   some correspondence with, and clippings from, individuals has been kept apart   from these biannual compilations.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> 9) All records and correspondence   relating to Assembling, Assembling Press, Future Press, and Archae (formerly   RK) Editions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> 10) The second copies   of hundreds of books and periodicals in which work has appeared. (I¹ve traditionally   requested at least two copies of all works, thinking of the second as what could   have been lent.)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> 11) Copies of the handwritten   notes customarily inserted in every book read and owned by me.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> None of this archive has   been sold before. (The Fales Collection of NYU Library received my father¹s   collections of third copies that had come to me.) The files alone probably run   close to one hundred feet in length, though I¹ve not been one to accumulate   excessively within each project. Copies of my books and periodicals run at least   ninety feet. Since I¹m reluctant to disperse my papers, it should be assumed   that the people acquiring this archive now will arrange to have my remaining   papers and productions. Ideally, this archive belongs in an institution that   can handle audio, video, holograms, and film along with paper.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> Would not five hundred   thousand dollars be an appropriate price? The aim is to keep me solvently independent   (away from deleterious employments) for the rest of my life. </font> </p></body></html>
