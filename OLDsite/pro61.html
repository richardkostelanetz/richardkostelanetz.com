Usually they are produced by the magazines¹ editors, especially   when the magazine is still being published; sometimes the retrospectives are   put together after the magazines has closed. In either case, my term for such   anthologies is Cultural Magazines¹ Retrospectives. This collection includes   ten books that were issued over four decades by <i>Partisan Review</i>, several   from <i>Saturday Review</i>, four from the <i>New Republic</i>, three from <i>transition</i>,   several from <i>Mad</i>, two from both <i>Exquisite Corpse</i> and <i>Evergreen   Review</i>, one apiece from both runs of the <i>Transatlantic Review</i>, and   one apiece from<i> Encounter</i>, <i>Agenda</i>, <i>Smithsonian</i>, <i>Typographica</i>,   <i>View</i>, <i>Artforum</i>, <i>Poetry</i>, <i>New Masses</i>, and <i>Psychedelic   Review</i>, among other magazines. I also have a few European examples as well--<i>De   Stijl</i>, <i>Nouvelle Revue Française</i>. As a veteran contributor to cultural   magazines, I assume that a principal reason for collecting such anthologies   is that much of the best American writing appears in their pages. Two factors   I like about Cultural Journals¹ Retrospectives as a subject for collecting are   1) that no one else known to me is concentrating on them; 2) that the number   of appropriate books is finally less than a thousand. One disadvantage is that   the category is so unfamiliar I customarily must explain it at least twice,   even to booksellers eager to unload their inventories. What Cultural Journals¹   Retrospectives offer intellectually is the opportunity to examine, better than   individual issues would, what a magazine has been doing. What I would like to   propose is curating a library exhibition devoted to such books, drawing upon   my collection as well as whatever other titles might be available in the host   library. I would like to write a catalog that, drawing upon earlier writings   of mine, would become a classic appreciation of this important, if under-noticed,   genre. I assume that this exhibition can tour, its contents changing in detail   in each new venue. Interested sponsors are invited to write me at the address   at the top of this page. Thank you.</font></p></body></html>
