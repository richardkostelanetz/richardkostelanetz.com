Box 444, Prince St.New York, NY 10012-0008NEW RETROSPECTIVE ON FICTION WRITING (2001), 1,275 words In over three decades that I've been publishing fiction, I have produced:1) a novella with no more than two words to a paragraph (and then, in one  published form, no more than two words to a book page)--<i>One Night Stood</i> (1978),2) stories in the shape of syntactically continuous loops that lack beginnings  or ends ("Infinities," 1998),3) a book of scrupulously <i>Minimal Fictions</i> (1993) that are no more than three  words in length, most having only two words or one prior to the period (aka full stop) that necessarily concludes the narrative action,4) stories that develop through a series of shapes that are composed  exclusively of letters or words ("Football Forms," 1968; <i>Come Here</i>, 1975, respectively),5) fictons consisting exclusively of words whose meaning changes with the  introduction not of other words but of different configurations of theinitial words or nonverbal imagery ("Obliterate," 1974),6) stories composed entirely of nonrepresentational line-drawings that metamorphose so systemically that each image in the sequence belongs only to its particular place (<i>Constructivist Fictions</i>, 1974-1991; <i>March</i>,1990),7) individual sentences that are either the openings or the closings of  otherwise unwritten stories (<i>Opening & Closings</i>, 1975),8) stories composed of just cut-up photographs whose chips move symmetrically  through narrative cycles ("Recall," 1982),9) separate modular fictions of photographs thatcan be read in any order (<i>Reincarnations</i>), of line-drawings whose positions in a sequence are  interchangeable (and thus can be shuffled) (<i>And So Forth</i>, 1979), of sentences that are reordered in systemic ways to produce different emphases of the same words and gestures (<i>Foreshortenings & Other Stories</i>, 1978), if not radically different stories,10) circular stories that flow from point to point but lack beginnings  or ends (in <i>More Short Fictions</i>, 1980),11) stories composed entirely of words that rhyme with one another--some two  words long, others three, most even more populous ("Rhyming," c. 1990),12) narratives, some only a page in length but one as long as a book, composed  exclusively ofnumerals (<i>Exhaustive Parallel Intervals</i>, 1979),13) a fiction composed of sixteen different (but complimentary) stories  interwoven in print in sixteen different typefaces and on audiotape told in sixteen purposefully different amplifications of a single voice ("Seductions," 1980, 1981),14) over two thousand single-sentence fictions representing the epiphanies of  over two thousand otherwise unwritten stories ("Epiphanies," since 1979),15) manuscripts of single-sentence stories that are offered to periodical  editors not to publish in toto but as pools from which they may make their own selections that can then be ordered and designed to their particular tastes ("Epiphanies"; "Openings," since the late 1980s;"Complete Stories," in the 1990s),16) a sequence of single-sentence stories that, thanks to structural complexities available in English, are each over two hundred words long ("Single-Sentence Stories" in <i>Prose Pieces</i>, 1987),17) A novella with the alphabet unfolding  in increasingly complex configurations over thirty pages (<i>In the Beginning</i>,1971).18) fiction books published in formats ranging from conventional spine-bound volumes to suchalternatives as tabloid-sized newsprint books (<i>Numbers: Poems & Stories</i>, 1976), loose-leaf books (whose pages are gathered in an envelope) (Rain Rains Rain, 1976), and accordion books that are opened to be four inches high and several feet long (<i>Extrapolate</i>, <i>Modulations</i>, both 1975),19) one film and a separate videotape whose imagery is nothing other than words  telling stories (<i>Openings & Closings</i>, 1976-78; "Video Stories," forthcoming),20) a film with symmetrical abstract fictions (described in #5 above) that  metamorphose in systemic sequence (<i>Constructivist Fictions</i>, 1976-77),20) fictions that exist primarily on audiotape--that cannot be performed live,  whose printed versions are no more than scores for their realization (<i>Ululation--An Acoustic Fiction</i>, 1992),22) books in which abstract sequences are presented both as separate entities (<i>Constructivist Fictions</i>) and  intermixed with other sequences, thereby creating a metastory composed of many individual stories (<i>Intermix</i>, 1991),23) "skeletal fiction" with horizontal sequences of words, separated by more  horizontal space than is customary, without blatant syntactical connectives (but narrative implications nonetheless) (c. 1988),24) paragraph-long narratives whose successivesentences either add a word to  or subtract a word from their immediate predecessor ("Plus/Minus," 1980),25) fictions whose narrative action comes from long words that are split apart  to become other shorter words or adding letters to short words to change with each extra digit their semantic thrust ("Recircuits," "Reroutings," "Recircuits," c. 1990),26) translations, initially into Chinese, of single-word fictions that are  published on the same page as the English original,27) a linear narrative whose single-scene paragraphs are no more than two words  in length ("Milestones in a Life," 1970)28) a fiction solely in the form of a family tree ("On Fortune and Fate,"  1969),29) two books of "conceptual" fictions in which thick spine-bound collections  of evenly cut blank pages are prefaced by a cover with a resonant title and subtitle ("Constructivist"), along with a page of words that establish a context for what follows (<i>Tabula Rasa</i>, <i>Inexistencs</i>,1978),30) "Overlapped Minimal Fictions" (1993) in which one continuous stream of letters contains three words, each of which incorporates at its ends at least the two opening letters of its successor or at its beginning at least the concluding two letters of its predecessor,31) a cycle of one hundred and twenty-seven erotic stories, each successively  one word longer than its immediate predecessor until, at sixty-four  words in length, each new story then becomes one word shorter than its immediate predecessor ("More or Less," c. 1980),32) a four-hour film composed of verbal and visual epiphanies that have no  connection to one another, either vertically or horizontally, other than common fictional structure (1981-93),33) videotapes whose abstract visual syntheses become an accompanying  counterpoint to the more concrete audio narration (Seductions/Re-lationships, 1987),34) a book of over one hundred <i>3-Element</i> <i>Stories</i> (1998), whose three physically separate words can be read in order before concluding with a period, with one story to a page,35) probably a few other departures whose character cannot yet, for better or  worse, be neatly encapsulated (????),36) the purest oeuvre of fiction, as fiction, uncompromised  by vulgar  considerations, that anyone has ever done,37) no conventional fiction--absolutely none--which is to say nothing that  could pass a university course/workshop in "fiction writing" (and get me a job teaching such), and no familiar milestone(s) from which simple-minded critics could then smugly measure my "departure."   Even though these fictions of mine have appeared in scores of literary magazines, and over a dozen volumes of these fictions have appeared in print (and my critical essays and manifestoes were collected as <i>The Old Fictions and the New</i>), while entries on me featuring my fiction appear in both the <i>Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i> (1995) and<i> A Reader'sGuide to 20th Century Fiction</i> (Oxford, 1995), there have been few reviews of individual books,no commercial contracts, no offers from small presses to do more books of my fiction, no grants for fiction writing, only two passing mentions in purportedly comprehensive surveys of contemporary fiction, little critical acknowledgement of my radicalaly alternative purposes in creating and publishing fiction; only one story was ever anthologized by someone else (Eugene Wildman, in his <i>Experiments in Prose</i> [1969]) though my poems are often anthologized.   Does anyone care?  Should anyone care (other than me)?  (Should I care?  If so, how?  Should I have written this or simply accepted avant-garde lumps?)  What should be made of the fact that no one else--absolutely no one elsevisible to us--in making fiction in these ways?</font></pre>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
