E. Cummings</i> (1998).  As many of these books are presently out of print, Preambles" would be the onlyplace in which these essays could be conveniently found. Several are regarded among the best of kind; most were prepublished in magazines; some have already been reprinted in anthologies edited by others. Each should be prefaced with a brief headnote, recalling the occasion for which it was written and perhaps describing the book it introduced; and "Preambles" will open with an introduction to the problems of introductions. The only book comparable to this is W. H. Auden's Forewords & Afterwords (1973), which actually contains, its title notwithstanding, more book reviews than essays initially written to introduce books. It is expected that readers interested in contemporary art, literature, criticism and social thought will continue to consult these essays and, thus, want to obtain "Preambles." Since over two hundred thousand copies of these earlier collections have already been sold, it can be assumed that many readers are familiar with the author's name and his work.</font></pre>    </td>  </tr>  <tr valign="top">    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
