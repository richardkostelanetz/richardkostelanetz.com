To my mind, the         initial measure of the success of any of my poems/stories/works of art         is their distance from what is already known (and what everyone else is         doing). A related measure, in my own mind, is a sort of audacious unacceptability.         It is not unreasonable to characterize my way of working as experimental,         which is to say that I often start with a conscious hypothesis, a radical         premise, that will shape my creation and, incidentally, insure that the         resulting work will be radically unusual. In the pieces collected here,         it can be observed that I have tried to discover whether it would be possible         to make:</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3">1.) poems not with         syntactical structures but individual words that are visually enhanced;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3">         2.) a poem composed of overlapping words, so that each new word would         contain at least three letters of its predecessor;</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> 3.) skeletal fictions         whose paragraphs have no more than three words that are not syntactically         sequential;</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3">4.) fictions composed         not of words, the traditional material of literature, but abstract, geometric         drawings and, in another example. photographs;</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> 5.) fictions composed         of overlapping words;</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> 6.) a film that         does not "adapt" an unusual literary text (Epiphanies) but duplicates         visually and aurally its scrupulously disconnected form;</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> 7.) video art composed         exclusively of electronic lettering and holograms likewise composed only         of words;</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> 8.) poems that depend         upon the discovery of short words within longer words;</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> 9) minimal fictions         no more than three words in length and often less;</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> 10) ballets that         are meant to be read, even if never performed;</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> 11) animation scenarios         that are meant to be read and seen, even if never filmed;</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> 12) texts of conteinuous         words that are not syntactically related;</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> 13) other unconventional         moves that are not so easily defined, some of which may have escaped my         memory, others of which I may not be so fully aware.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> Perhaps the most         puzzling departure is the numerical work, which is really not as forbidding         as it looks initially. In Two Intervals, for instance, it can be observed         that every number relates to those adjacent to it, either vertically or         horizontally, by the interval of either one or three, plus or minus (bearing         in mind that, in this ten-digit system, nine plus one is zero, or one         minus three is eight). To "read" such pieces, it is true, one must be         numerate, just as the prerequisite for reading poetry is literacy. One         heuristic question to ask of this and other numerical works of mine is         whether it is poetry or fiction or something else--perhaps an art composed         exclusively of numbers, which is to say a numerical art? Though the work         is original, it is not obscure--not at all; indeed, here and elsewhere         the work reflects a taste for conscious propositions, rational procedures,         and verifiable perceptions. Another departure is experimenting with literary         abstraction, or discovering whether an idea so acceptable in modern visual         art and music can be applied to literature. After working for over a quarter         century in this way, I still find it odd that sophisticated people who         can understand painterly abstraction without blinking can sometimes claim,         when confronted with my versions of its literary analogy, that such work         is "meaningless" or "trivial" or some other pseudo-critical obscenity.         To such objections there are, of course, two sides; for if they were not         made, that silence would indicate to me that this (or any other) work         of mine should, in principle, be destroyed as unacceptable. Especially         in America, writers who do conventional poetry and fiction customarily         limit their "writing" to the medium of print; but perhaps the fundamental         experimental hypothesis behind my creative career has been discovering         not only whether initially literary ideas can work in audio or video or         film but, more important, whether I can work, either as the sole artist         or as an equal collaborator, in media other than printed pages. And by         so doing what no other writer is doing (or has done), I hope to expand         our sense of what is possible not just in art but in imaginative literary         life. One quality I wish for my activity, as well as individual works,         is that they be neither common nor predictable (except perhaps for their         capacity to surprise), and yet make sense in retrospect. . </font></p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
