Its predecessorswere Twenties in the Sixties (1979), The Old Poetries and theNew (1981), The Old Fictions and the New (1987), On InnovativeMusic(ian)s (1989), The New Poetries and Some Old (1991), OnInnovative Art(ist)s (1982), On Innovative Performance(s)(1984), and One Million Words of Book Notes, 1959-93 (1996),in a broad critical enterprise that might be without precedentin the history of American arts criticism.  As in the earliervolumes, the essays here articulate a position about the primacyof possibilities intrinsic in each medium.  Just as music isprimarily about the cunning organization of sound, so film andvideo are primarily about kinetic images that are sometimesaccompanied by sound (and yet are subtly different from eachother).  To understand film or even video as species ofliterature is no less a distraction than understandingliterature as an off-shoot of sociology; for a critic to commitsuch sins is to wind up in a ditch or, alas, a slick magazine.Another implicit assumption behind my activity is acknowledgingthe importance of books in collecting together initiallyscattered opinions, for I have long contended that the criticwho fails to risk publishing books is just a reviewingjournalist or, worse, an opportunist. Some of the essays here initially appeared in magazines.  Thelast section, previous unpublished, was drawn from notecards,each 4" by 6", that I began to type in 1959, sometimes usingboth sides, where I described and judged films I had seen.These resemble he chronicles that have appeared in other booksof mine.  What impresses me most, looking at these cards now, ishow conscientiously I treated this process of critical notemaking (and how I could not marshal such seriousness today, inpart because I never became a regular reviewer of things I caredlittle about, but mostly because I am now more predisposed toforget what is not important).  Partly because I witnessed filmsnot normally reviewed or commonly seen (not to mention filmsignored by such putatively encyclopedic directories as LeonardMaltin's or Steven M. Scheuer¹s), I gathered some of these noteshere.  In the 1970s I became a video artist and a decade later afilmmaker; so that the essays in the middle two sections of thebook reflect this experience, not only with theory but withdetailed accounts of how my alterntive films, both narrativeand documentary, were made.  This is the book¹s table of contents, with current pagination:FILM AND VIDEO CRITICISM  9The Artistry of Television Football (1969)  10Recent Experimental Film Reconsidered (1970)  16Orson Welles as an Acoustic Filmmaker (1989)  34Literary Videotapes (1989)  45Waiting for Revisionism (1991)  52Nam June Paik Remembrance (1992)  46The Institutionalization of Ignorance (1993)  47II: EXPERIMENTATION AND THEORYLiterary Video (1976)  50Film (1977)  52Video Writing (1987)  52My Nonsync, Two-Person Films (1989)  58Authenticity in "Documentary" (1991)  65Language-Based Videotapes (1992)  68III: SCRIPTSEpiphanies (1993)  72Home Movies Reconsidered (1989)  78Six Versions of A Berlin Lost (1992)  91IV: NOTES OF A RELUCTANT FILMGOER1959-94  109V: TRANIMATIONS: POETRY/FILM STORYBOARDS(which are 1999 scripts for verbal animations but meant finallyfor print, in the tradition of Moholy¹s "Dynamic of aMetropolis")Index  ???About the Author ???Publishers interested in considering the latest print-out areadvised to contact the author.</font></pre></body></html>
