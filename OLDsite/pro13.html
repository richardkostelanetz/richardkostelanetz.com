It would exclude as well a   painter who merely dabbled in poetry or playwriting, rather than excelling at   it, such as Pablo Picasso.) After defining the polyartistic imagination in general,   I would have chapter(s) on such historical precursors as Leonardo da Vinci and   William Blake. In the next chapters, I plan to reinterpret Dada, Futurism, Surrealism,   and the Bauhaus as polyartistic movements, showing how endeavors in several   arts esthetically resemble one another in each group. The remainder of the book   will be devoted to discussing modern exemplars, tentatively organized around   the following chapters: 1) Marcel Duchamp, 2) L. Moholy-Nagy, 3) El Lissitzky-Theo   van Doesburg-Hans (Jean) Arp, 4) Kurt Schwitters, 5) Jean Cocteau-Wyndham Lewis,   6) R. Buckminster Fuller, 7) John Cage. Concluding chapters will cover the polyartistic   activities of such contemporaries as Leonora Carrington, Andy Warhol, Claes   Oldenburg, Michael Show, Dan Graham, Charles Henri Ford, Robert Morris, Dick   Higgins, Meredith Monk, and Tom Phillips, among others.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> In most of these chapters   I expect to define qualities common to a polyartist¹s work in more than one   domain and/or identify those fundamental esthetic ideas that are expressed in   various arts. The key to Moholy-Nagy, for instance, is geometric structuring;   to John Cage, nonhierarchic space and time. My radical conclusion would suggest   that the polyartist is a different kind of creative figure, whose oeuvre cannot   be compared with those of monoartists, any more than a writer be compared with   a painter, and then that polyartists are best considered as their own breed,   with their own traditions, who would best be compared with one another. <b>Modern   Polyartistry</b> should be about 70,000 words in length, with chapters of roughly   5,000 words apiece, and include many illustrations of visual art, musical scores,   and literary texts. It should particularly interest students, teachers, and   adventurous practitioners of all the arts. </font></p></body></html>
