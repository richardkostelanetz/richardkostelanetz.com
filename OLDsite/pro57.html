In James Joyce¹s theory   of the short story, we remember, the epiphany is the encompassing climactic   moment that functions to illuminate the entire story. In my own stories, likewise   entitled <b>Epiphanies</b>, I have tried to suggest the same momentous quality   within a single sentence, which is to say that my epiphanies are meant to be   so evocatively sufficient that the remainder of the story, neither ahead nor   behind, need not be told. Collected together, these climactic moments (within   otherwise nonexistent stories) provoke a fictional experience that is not linear,   but spatial; not sequential, but thoroughly discontinuous; not nineteenth-century,   but twentieth. No story in <b>Epiphanies</b> is more important than any other;   no story is intentionally connected to another. In context, none is merely transitional.   Another aim was to exploit the freedoms of its open-ended form to touch upon   the fullest range of human experience--to write perhaps the most universal fiction   ever written.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Wishing to extend this   narrative principle into film, I decided that, instead of making my own climactic   moments, it would be better to find Epiphanies in outtakes gathered from other   filmmakers. Had I shot my own footage, I figured, the style of a single cameramen   or director would inevitably impose a consistency utterly contrary to my purpose   of making each sequence a distinctly separate entity, as well as contrary to   my desire for universality. So, thousands of feet of 16 mm. film, in a diversity   of formats and styles, gathered from the widest variety of sources, were viewed   to find the few hundred feet that I have so far used. For the soundtrack, I   drew upon individually processed readings of my stories, by a cast of fifty   readers; so that while the stories heard never compliment the stories seen,   the soundtrack and visual track are esthetically similar, not only in unending   climaxes, but in utter discontinuity. As of 2000, I have nearly four hours of   16 mm spliced film (which has never been printed or copied), nearly four hours   of videotapes in three formats (U-Matic 4 X 60¹; a single VHS at EP speed; two   VHS at SP speed); four hours of audiotape in several formats (including audio-only   continuous VHS). The work is so various and abundant that people viewing it   tend to come away with 1.) a sense of a whole and 2.) moments, either verbal   or visual, that particularly appeal to them. In my experience, everyone has   his or her favorites, usually for personal reasons (and whether these favorites   are visual or verbal often indicates much about his or her perceptual outlook).   In other words, the film <b>Epiphanies</b> is so expansively open that the only   quality I as author/artist can expect viewers to perceive is its esthetic theme:   The exhaustive experience of the experience of story. Anything else any viewer   takes away is, literally, his or her own to possess.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> As the film becomes longer   and more various, it becomes, in truth, more impossible to view in conventional   ways. Several people who have seen the same version-in-progress twice have asked   me if "the second film differed from the first." This indicates not trickery   on my part but a quality peculiar to <b>Epiphanies</b>: A film so rich in discrete   parts simply cannot be assimilated thoroughly in a single sitting. With this   problem in mind, let me suggest that it is best viewed in situations where members   of the audience can enter and leave as they wish, confident that they could   return at any point without difficulty. While they have, it is true, missed   certain episodes, they would not, upon their return, in any sense feel lost.   In that case it would be more appropriate to show the film continuously in public   spaces where people could stay as long as they wished, perhaps because they   had time on their hands. The possibilities that come immediately to mind would   be waiting rooms at airports, hotel lobbies and other semi-public places (even   movie houses) where moderately sophisticated people would be pleased to discover   footage not just different in quality from what they normally see but also more   interesting than Musak and yet less demanding than a book. If anyone reading   this proposal has any specific ideas, please contact the artist/author at the   address at the top of this page. Thank you. </font> </p></body></html>
