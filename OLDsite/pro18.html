Nothing from the previous   volume will be included, though I hope to draw upon the German Autobiographien   New York Berlin (Merve, 1985), which contained some new material. Imaginatively   designed by Peter Buchanan-Smith as a 192-page dummy, 8 1/2" high, 11" wide,   Autobiographies at Fifty contains "Person of Letters in the Contemporary World,"   from Contemporary Authors: Autobiography Series, Vol. VIII (1989); "Keeping   Afloat in New York: A Memoir" from Menu (1985) and, revised, Home Planet News   (1989); "My House Wordship," and two extended interviews. As before, one recurring   theme of these essays is surviving as an independent writer. As the principal   changes in my life in the past decade have come from living and working in Europe,   several chapters will draw upon essays reflecting this subject "A New Yorker's   Berlin," from Exquisite Corpse (1985) and Views of Berlin (Birkhauser, 1989);   my contribution to "Writing and Politics" in Fiction International (1984). It   also incorporates new examples of self-revelatory documents similar to those   included in the predecessor, including "1986," "Alternative Complements," "Career   Contradictions," and "Dedications." Any publisher interested in considering   the dummy should contact me. Thank you. </font></p></body></html>
