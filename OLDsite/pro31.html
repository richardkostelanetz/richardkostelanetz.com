The work hasbeen recognized in such scholarly surveys as the Columbia LiteraryHistory of the United States (1988) and featured in individual entries insuch compendia as Contemporary Novelists (St. James Press, since1978); Larry McCaffery¹s Postmodern Fiction (Greenwood, 1986); AReader¹s Guide to 20th Century Writers (Oxford, 1996), where I amone of a select thousand living and dead; Webster¹s Dictionary ofAmerican Authors (1996); Britannica.com(since 2000); and theMerriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature (1995), where my name isamong 10,000 entries from all times.The work is stylistically different, to be sure, often courting theextremes of literary minimalism with single-sentence narratives andother stories that are only one word, two words, or three words inlength. Nonetheless, perhaps because my fiction is rarely willfullyobscure it appears so frequently in the world¹s literary journals. Whenthe publishers listed in the annual Directory of Poetry Publishers areasked which five authors they particularly favor for their pages, myname is customarily ranked around seventh.However, several books of my fiction remain unpublished:1) Epiphanies, which is a huge collection of single-sentence stories thatare meant to be the epiphanies, in the James Joycean sense, ofotherwise nonexistent stories. So many of these exist that I couldimagine them appearing in several volumes that should ideally betypographically striking.2) 1001 Short Stories, which are single-sentences stories that, unlikethe Epiphanies that radiate outwards, are meant to be entirely self-contained. These can be published with or without the accompanying numerals. A sample was imaginatively designed with various interwoven typefaces.3) More Openings & Closings, which are what the title says: openingsof otherwise nonexistent stories alternating with closings that have noostensible connection to the openings. This is a sequel to a Openings &Closings that was published in 1975 by a Manhattan art gallery.4) Lovings, which are seventy pages of single-sentence narrativesabout various emotional-sexual experiences. This I¹ve tong regardedas the initial text for any publisher making an extended commitment tomy fiction.5) More Portraits From Memory, which collects over 200 single-pageexclusively verbal portraits of past loves.6) Reflections On Lovings & Relationships, which is a short text ofthoughtful aphorisms (unlike fictions) that can, if vividly illustrated,become a book.7) More Minimal Fictions, which would be a sequel to Minimal Fictions(Asylum Arts, 1993), likewise containing one-word, two-word, andthree-word stories in a variety of expressive typefaces.8) 201 Contemporary Ballets, which are short scenarios for physicalmovement-achoreographic analogue for drama scripts.Needless to say perhaps, I have published many other books that arenot well-known--that are in most public collections and the privatelibraries of most literate people. Thus, if most works of fictioncustomarily appear with no assured sales, these would have at least afoundation of interest. Should any agent or publisher like to considerany of these manuscripts, please let me hear from you at the addressat the top of this page. Thank you.</font></pre></body></html>
