Even I have few competitors in suchpioneering esthetic enterprise, I¹m not done yet.--Richard Kostelanetz, Wordworks: Poems New &Selected (1993) REFACEIf the principal theme of my poetry has been invention,one motive of the poems written since Wordworks(1993), my first elaborate collection, has been theclashing of languages. This reflects initially my interestin writing poems in languages I barely know--forinstance, the French and German Strings reprinted there. Asalways, I make a move and then look for surprisingresults. Here one move is interweaving the letters ofwords in two languages; another comes from jammingtwo words together to form not only a larger word but anevocative intersection. Many other poetic developmentsshould follow from these initial moves. Some dependsupon understanding two languages; others, not.‹‹Richard Kostelanetz, New York, NY</font></pre></body></html>
