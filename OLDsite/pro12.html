D. Hirsch, and now Harold Bloom,I propose to write a book of approximately 250 pages withapproximately two dozen black and white illustrations.Going beyond the exclusively literary bias of all these books,I would propose that literacy in our time should includefamiliarity with more than classic books; it should encompassas well basic knowledge of visual art in all forms, music bothclassical and popular, dance, sports, and the new intermediaarts. Contemporary literacy is not complete withoutdiscriminative knowledge of history, science, social science,and new technologies, beginning with computers. More practically,literacy should include the ability to read machine manualsalong with experience at reading novels. My thesis is that noone is truly literate unless he or she aims for competentknowledge in all these areas. (The contrast is partial literacyrepresented by Hirsch and the two Blooms--a partial literacythat becomes increasingly limited in our culturally richertimes.) Since this book will be written in my most accessiblestyle, I¹d like to think it could become a best-seller in thewake of the books noted above.Most of <b>Contemporary American Literacy</b> will have chapters ondifferent areas, outlining with choice examples variousdimensions of basic literacy. My principal recurring theme inunderstanding any intellectual discipline or art is that each isabout issues and histories unique to it. Simply, a new work ofpainting, say, becomes important for its contribution to aperceived tradition of painting, not for the "truth" of its"content." Knowledge and experience of the best past endeavorsis the principal prerequisite for perceiving new work in anyfield, including, say, new machine manuals. A second theme holdsthat genuine literacy depends upon discrimination and thus aknowledge of excellence. It isn¹t enough that one knowssomething about a "field"; it is more important to master whatis best in each discipline and know why. A third theme dear tome is that no area of knowledge is intrinsically superior to anyother, which is to say that no art or field of endeavor isnecessarily less accessible than any other--each does the Lord¹swork in different ways. (Since I¹m not a professor of this orthat, I have no privileged reason to tout one discipline asprimary knowledge.) A fourth theme is that literacy in Americatoday is necessarily different from classical, European, orOriental literacy. I find it important that most educated people,if presented with these four themes, agree with them.   The practical issue becomes how to deal with these themes ina book. After a critique of partial literacy in our time, Iwould broach basic literacy in several areas, focusing uponmasterpieces. For an epigraph I might use this from HaroldBloom: "The Canon was (and is) formed by the great writersthemselves, who work in the mode of their precursors (thuscanonizing them) and are in turn canonized implicitly by thegreat writers who come after them, and are influenced by them."I like this formulation because even though it reflects Bloom¹scommitment to only bookish literacy, the principle is applicableto many areas from visual arts to mathematics to sports (wheregreat new performance is acclaimed precisely because it enhancesas it reflects previous superior performance).  Noting how many young people develop basic intellectualdiscipline through enthusiasms for one or another kind of massculture, such as popular music or sports, it might beinteresting to start the book with a chapter on sports literacy,which involves of course a familiarity with the preciseachievements of the major performers. I would conclude the bookwith advice on organizing knowledge, beginning with note-takingand filing. If this book succeeds, I could imagine itcontributing to the discussion of curriculum in America.In contrast to Hirsch and the two Blooms, who seem moreconcerned with distinguishing Ins from Outs (in schemesreminiscent of Esquire chartings of the American literary scene),I wish to denigrate not individuals or their works but limitedmodes of literacy.   As I think of myself as literate in most of these areas,having written about nearly all of them at various times, mostchapters will be my introductions to excellence, focusing uponvarious individuals and achievements of the first rank. I planto write as one literate adult speaking to another andconcluding with useful bibliographies. In those few areasproblematic to me, such as mathematics and computer/machinemanuals, I may incorporate the advice of colleagues. I imaginea book of 20 chapters, each 5,000 words in length. It should bededicated to the memory of Marshall McLuhan, who, though he waspersonally bookish, taught me about the insufficiences ofbookish literacy in our times.In the following outline, I¹ve noted possible chapters and lefta few open for discoveries made in the course of writing (e.g.,food and drink):TENTATIVE OUTLINE1) Contemporary American Literacy2) History, emphasizing such masterpieces as Edward Gibbon¹sThe Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire and Richard Hofstadter¹sAmerican Political Tradition.3) Sports, focusing upon such great sportsmen as Babe Ruth,Julius Erving, Bobby Hull, Pele, et al. (which is to say theguys who revolutionized their games)4) Poetry, featuring Walt Whitman, T. S. Eliot, and E. E.Cummings, among others5) Fiction, discussing Miguel de Cervantes, William Faulkner,Jorge-Luis Borges, Gertrude Stein6) Theater, with Shakespeare. Samuel Beckett, nonliteraryperformance7) Exposition, with Michel de Montaigne, Charles Lamb, H. L.Mencken8) Music, with J. S. Bach, W. A. Mozart, Charles Ives, DukeEllington9) Visual Arts, with Islamic art, Michelangelo, the moderns.10) Dance, with Isadora Duncan, Fred Astaire, Merce Cunningham11)Film, with D. W. Griffith, Buster Keaton, contemporaries12)Architecture, from the Parthenon to Frank Lloyd Wright,Buckminster Fuller, and the works of the best contemporaries13)Television/Video, with Ernie Kovacs, and recent video artists,such as Nam June Paik14) Polyartistry, with Wm. Blake, L. Moholy-Nagy, John Cage15) Social Science, with Thorstein Veblen, Margaret Mead16) Science, with Galileo, Albert Einstein17) Machine Manuals, with those for VCRs, computers, automobiles18) Mathematics, with Descartes, Henri Poincaré, Alfred NorthWhitehead, Benoit Mendelbrot19) Philosophy/Theology, with St. Thomas, H. Niebuhr, L.Wittgenstein20) Organizing Knowledge and Realizing Literacy, or how to makethe most intelligent use of the information you acquireAfter taking degrees in cultural history, I have at one time oranother written about all the arts, in addition to othercultural areas, and that my home library, once featured on thefront page of the NY Times Thursday Home section, includesseveral thousand books, several hundred records and audiotapes,and hundreds of videotapes. Most of the research for this bookhas already been done in the course of my professional work;most of it can be written from resources immediately at hand.Were the book contracted soon after the receipt of this proposal,I would expect to deliver a completed manuscript on discs withinfifteen months.</font></pre></body></html>
