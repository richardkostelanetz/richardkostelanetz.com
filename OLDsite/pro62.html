As the theme is the character   and impact of the place upon an individual life, it will eschew not only testimony   from anyone else but any talking heads, including mine. On screen will be only   New York City scenes relating to the author¹s spoken text, the personal becoming   universal through an approach that is impersonal. Most of these scenes will   be shot especially for the film; some will be drawn from historical footage,   home movies shot by my father and others, and photographs. My colleague Peter   Longauer, long a distinguished animator, has incorporated photographs into documentaries   and is a generally brilliant editor. The cameraman should be especially skilled   at shooting buildings and bucolic urban activites. I will speak the text against   a background soundtrack including passages from my electro-acoustic composition   <i>New York City</i> (Westdeutscher Rundfunk, 1984), which has been aired over   radio stations and in museums (including the Whitney in New York). I can¹t think   of any precursors for this, obvious though the subject seems, excerpt perhaps   Alfred Kazin¹s prose memoir <i>A Walker in the City</i> (1951), where is less   about the City¹s effect on him than his purportedly transcending the City. Our   estimate for total costs, including fees for us, would be $150,000. Foundations   interested in supporting what we think will be a Public Television Classic (and   gettng prominent credit) should contact me at the address at the top of this   page. Enclosed are relevant resumés. I can also provide upon request drafts   of my narration and Longauer¹s shooting notes. Note that while we do not currently   have nonprofit affiliation, we are sure we can find, if necessary, an appropriate   umbrella. </font> </p></body></html>
