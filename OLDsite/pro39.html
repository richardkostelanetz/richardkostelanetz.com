Otherwise, I envision a book at least 320 pages long,   and among the historical contributors would be Henry David Thoreau, Josiah Warren,   Benjamin R. Tucker, Stephen Pearl Andrews, Adin Ballou, Lysander Spooner, Albert   Jay Nock and Emma Goldman. From contemporaries I would expect to select choice   works by Dwight Macdonald ("The Root Is Man"), Kenneth Rexroth, Paul Goodman   ("The Black Flag of Anarchism"), Karl Hess ("The Death of Politics"), John Cage,   Robert Nozick, Thomas Sowell, Ayn Rand, Thomas Szasz, Murray Rothbard, Dorothy   Day, and Murray Bookchin ("Post-Scarcity Anarchism"). The book would close with   a bibliography of further readings. In structure and polemical thrust, The Libertarian   Tradition would resemble the anthologies of futuristic social thought (Beyond   Left & Right, Social Speculations, Human Alternatives, The Edge of Adaptation)   that I did for Wm. Morrow and Prentice-Hall over a quarter-century ago. If only   because we are reaching in America now the edge of widespread change in our   ways of thinking about politics, I¹d like to believe that now would be a propitious   time to publish The Libertarian Tradition.
