Lincoln Kirstein speaks of the epithet dance as "the   pretext which provides a possibility for an audience to suspend momentarily   their natural expectation of logic, and accept the lyric super-logic of a ballet   libretto." Never before has anyone tried to collect between a single set of   covers such texts as Nam June Paik's "Crawl into the vagina of a whale," William   Empson's "The Elephant and the Birds" (1942), E. E. Cummings' tom (based on   Uncle Tom's Cabin), Remy Charlip's "Bound for Stardom," Ruth Krauss's "In a   Bull's Eye," Edward Gorey ballets, Louis Ferdinand Celine's "Van Bagaden," Edmund   Wilson's "Cronkhite's Clocks," Woody Allen's "A Guide to Some of the Lesser   Ballets," and several texts by such Italian futurists as Mario Scaparro, Arnaldo   Corradini-Emilio Settimelli, Francesco Congiullo (all of them already translated   in Michael Kirby's Futurist Performance anthology that has been long out-of-print).   While my table of the contents is by no measure complete, I know from experience   that if an anthologist begins with a clear concept (from which pretenders are   easily excluded) and allows six months to hear about additional examples, the   result will be a book. (It also helps to announce your project in such media   as the New York Times Book Review and the Times Literary Supplement, as well   as soliciting such likely contributors as Robert Wilson and Elizabeth Streb.)   There should be an introduction in part about this intermedium between scenarios   and conceptual art, but also about unrealized theatrical literature. Whatever   length the publisher deems most appropriate shall be met. Any publisher wishing   to consider examples of Conceptual Dance should contact the author at the address   at the top of this page. </font> </p></body></html>
