In most (perhaps all) cases, the   music existed prior to the production of the film; so that the film represents   a interpretative performance, much as a concert or record do. I think it best   to start the survey with Walt Disney¹s <i>Fantasia</i> (1940), which I consider   a masterpiece of the form, even doing an individual entry on it in my <i>Dictionary   of the Avant-Garde</i>s (1973, 2000). Another reason for making it a good place   to begin is its familiarity. From <i>Fantasia</i>, the narrative should first   go backwards into remembering prior animations of music, particularly those   of Oscar Fischinger (about whom, also see my <i>Dictionary</i>). From there   we can go forwards in time, discussing at length and in detail not only other   animators¹ responses to Fantasia, including Warner Brother¹s <i>The Corny Concerto</i>   (1943) and the many Friz Freleng¹s films involving music, but also the more   experimental endeavors in this vein of James and John Whitney. Another film   to notice is Bruno Bozzetto¹s feature-length <i>Allegro Non Troppo</i> (1976),   which combines mundane live-action with clever animation. I¹d like to find and   identify good rock videos that depend upon animation. Need I say that I have   worked in this genre myself, producing videotapes based upon my electro-acoustic   compositions. I see this book as a sequel to my "The Art of Radio in North America,"   as both are partially about recognizing values of high art in work previously   neglected, because of origins either too commercial or too obscure, and hope   that the two books would be published with companion designs.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> I envision <b>Animated   Music</b> as a short book, perhaps 100,000 words, with some illustrations. With   sufficient support, it would take two years to write. In addition to appealing   to enthusiasts for such films who are not yet conscious of it as a genre, the   book could also be used in courses based in both film and music, in addition   to informing a film series. </font> </p></body></html>
