Reel to reel audiotapes         or cassettes (with Dolby B or C, or DBX), stereo (unless otherwise noted),         can be supplied from, and should be returned to, the above address.

All         public performances should be reported to ASCAP or its European affiliates.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Invocations</b>         (1981) incorporates prayers spoken by over four dozen ministers, in over         two dozen languages, into duets, quintets, choruses and successive solos         that are ultimately about the sound of the language of prayer. Recorded         in West Berlin, this was mixed at the Electronic Music Studio of Stockholm         and subsequently acknowledged in Thomas B. Holmes¹s Electronic and Experimental         Music (1985), among other books. There are six versions that are identical         for 58¹ but have different openings that are roughly 3¹ long: 1) Hebrew-         Assyriac; 2) English; 3) Swedish-Danish-English; 4) Latin; 5) German;         6) Mediterranean languages. The first is available on Folkways (FRS 37092).</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Americas¹ Game:         Baseball</b> (1988) is an extended composition of and about sounds unique         to the most popular game in North and Central America, in two parts, 29:40         & 29:55.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>New York City</b>         (1983-84) is three compositions of and about sounds particular to my hometown,         initially commissioned by Westdeutscher Rundfunk for a series of programs         about the world¹s great metropolises, which can be played with thousands         of slides of images likewise unique to New York, in either a concert or         continuous installation‹one 60¹ for international broadcast, another 87¹,         and a third version 140¹ for American audiences.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>The Gospels</b>         (1982) is a continuous fugue of the opening four books of the New Testament         here, since they tell the same story, heard simultaneously--an exhausting         piece that, in my considered opinion, is nonetheless filled with luminous         passages, 120¹. <b>Die Evangelien</b> (1982) is the same, but in German         and considerably abridged, 60¹.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Excelsior</b>         (1975) swiftly portrays a seduction in single-word paragraphs, spoken         in stereo by two voices, which sound as though they may be the same voice,         1:20.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Plateaux</b>         (1975) has a solo voice reciting a text about a love affair to the background         of a steadily declining synthesizer. 2:50</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Milestones in         a Life</b> (1976) tells, amidst changing reverberation, of 77 years of         a bourgeois life in terms of the single most important event (milestone)         to happen in each year, 3:55</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>This Is My Poem</b>         (1977) is a series in which that root phrase is subjected to several kinds         of tape-delay, each of which accents different parts of the phrase. They         too can be broadcast individually, in immediate succession, or between         others works, :55, :54, :42, 2:10.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Declaration of         Independence</b> (1975) is based upon a text written for the American         bicentennial, in which the familiar words of the historic American document         are read backwards word by word, in this case by a chorus of male voices,         each one trying to be in unison with the others, but ultimately failing.         One version of this work, perhaps more suitable for popular radio broadcast,         incorporates into the course of the piece three sets of explanatory voice-over         remarks, 10:01.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Foreshortenings</b>         (1976) has 84 sentences that are rearranged in several systematic ways         to suggest alternative stories. Here they are read in one version by the         author in dialogues with a quartet of himself (26:00) and in another version         by the author in a duet with John Morgan (23:00). Incidentally, Charles         Dodge has incorporated a portion of this text into a piece of computer         speech synthesis entitled <i>He Met Her in the Park</i> in English and         <i>Han Motte Henne I Parken</i> in Swedish. The first is 25:00; the second,         17:00. Both are available from him at Holland Hill Rd., Putney, VT 05346,         802-387-4610.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Seductions</b>         (1981) contains sixteen seduction stories told by sixteen different amplifications         of the same voice and interwoven one sentence at a time into a continuous,         albeit spatial narrative, 24:46.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Relationships</b>         (1983) is an extended recital of a man¹s recollections of why he slept         with certain women, as well as his conjectures of why they slept with         him, all elaborately processed electronically, and, in truth, not recommended         for juvenile audiences, 31:10.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Conversations</b>         (1983) are a sequence of twenty-seven pieces1 various in length, in which         three German words--Jah, Nein, Doch--are exchanged in various, infinitely         suggestive ways. This was composed on a Fairlight CMI during a residency         at PASS in New York City, :32, 1:25, :24, 1:30, :15, :57, :21, 1:22, 5:49,         :18, :40, 1:06, 5:00, 1:46, 1:55, :27, 1:35, 2:13, :24, 2:15, :46, :17,         :42, :17, 4:29, 2:51, :52. Like other multi-part sets of mine, these pieces         may be played individually, in continuous sequence, or interspersed between         other pieces. <b>Dialogues</b> (1975) are skeletal, implicitly erotic         conversations between two voices--one male, the other female--speaking         only two words, "yes" and "no", :35, :30, :35. A later version was done         in German (1983), with the addition of a third voice (Œdoch" for sure),         all processed on a Fairlight CMI (computer Music Instrument), :40, :30,         :18, :12, :09, :07, :045, :03, 1:00, 2:00, 3:00, :03. Individual sections         of both versions may be played/broadcast individually, in immediate succession         or apart from each other, say, between other pieces in the course of a         concert/program.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Richard Kostelanetz         Mantra </b>(1977) sounds as though I am repeating the trochaic rhythms         of my name without taking a breath, as its volume runs down into silence.         It is the most appropriate coda to any concert of my work, 1:40.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>What¹s in a Name</b>         (1983) explores, in six movements, the trochaic rhythms of my name with         various superhuman enhancemnets (mostly from a Fairlight CMI), 7:25.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Resume</b> (1986),         with me reading about me, with linear disintegration and variable disintegration,         both processed by Skip Brunner, each 37:20.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Turfs/Arenas/Pitches/Fields</b>         (1980) are four-word poems--one hundred in English, eleven in French--spoken         in unison by a chorus of four, processed in various ways at EMS, 21;26.         Grounds, etc. is a sequel with sets of eight related words spoken in unison         by a chorus of eight, 10:28.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Carnival of the         Animals</b> (1988), a poem of animal names, produced with a sampler and         synthesizer, read by the author in English, and in an acoustic German         translation by Tilman Reitzle, each 14:03.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Onomatopoeia</b>         (1988), produced with similar equipment, in two versions, one heavily         processed, the other not, both read by the author, each 10:42.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>The Drunken Boat/Le         Bateau Ivre</b> (1986), a binaural reading, with the French original on         one side and English translations on the other, one by Jonathan Cott read         by Janet Cannon (and processed by Skip Brunner), the other by Charles         Doria, each, 5:38</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Praying to the         Lord</b> (1977, 1981) has two sacred texts, the Lord¹s Prayer in English         and a comparable Hebrew prayer, which are successively and progressively         multiplied into fugues of eight voices, sixty-four voices and 512 voices,         5:40.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>The Eight Nights         of Hanukah</b> (1983) is the familiar prayer for lighting the candles,         here read by two dozen laymen of diverse ages speaking Hebrew with a variety         of accents, in various styles, mixed with each other into eight separate         fugues of successively increasing voices, 5:20.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Asdescent/Anacatabasis</b>         (1978) are electronically processed readings of two related pieces that         draw upon the texts of my reworkings of sentences from the Biblical I         Corinthians 13. Each is 23:00, mono, and, in truth, more difficult as         a listening experience than most of my works.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Epiphanies</b>         (1982-92) is a large number of single-sentence stories that are given         individual settings.
