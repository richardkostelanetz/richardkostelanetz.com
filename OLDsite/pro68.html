Sounding like an old Spanish, Ladino is thus different from the   Spanish spoken today by Jews in, say, Argentina and Mexico. Indeed, Ladino is   reportedly closer in sound to the language of Christopher Columbus than any   other Spanish heard today. What I would like to do is an hour-long audio feature   about this language in which I would ask Ladino-speakers living in America to   explain in their own (English) words the differences between their language   and the Spanish spoken here and, by extension, the importance of Ladino. I may   also record excerpts on these issues. Since I have previously done compositions   of and about the sound of unique sources (the language of prayer, the Hebrew   of the Diaspora, New York City, baseball), it would seem appropriate to conclude   the feature with a multitrack composition that would for its acoustic material   draw upon phrases used earlier in the feature and other characteristically Ladino   articulations. I have been promised the assistance of Ladino-speaking relatives   of mine, in addition to the relatives of Sephardic colleagues. Once I begin   the project, I expect to contact the officials of synagogues with Ladino-speaking   congregations around the U.S.. For budget, I would estimate $18,000, which would   include $8,000 for me as the producer-interviewer-announcer (working quarter-time   for an entire year), $3,000 for assisting and expert personnel, $2,500 for travel   to recording sites within the U.S., $500 for audiotape (including multitrack),   $1,500 for rental of at least 50 hours in a multitrack studio, $1,000 for at   least 100 hours in a two-track editing studio, $500 for telephone and other   corrinunication. This tape will also be offered to stations around the world   that have previously broadcast my work: National Public Radio, American Public   Radio, British Broadcasting Corporation, Australian Broadcasting, Sender Freies   Berlin, RIAS, Westdeutscher Rundfunk, Sveriges Radio. </font> </p></body></html>
