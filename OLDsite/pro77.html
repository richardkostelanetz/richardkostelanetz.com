Space permitting,   it would perhaps include reproductions of tables of contents, excerpts from   introductions and comprehensive bibliographical data. Materials from this catalogue   could also be displayed. The exhibition would be the first of its kind, to my   knowledge, and would probably be particularly appropriate for libraries with   modest exhibition facilities. Interested sponsors should contact the author   at the address at the top of this page. Thank you. </font> </p></body></html>
