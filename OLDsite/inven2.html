These are six versions of the same documentary         footage, made in collaboration with Martin Koerber of West Berlin, co-produced         with Literarisches Colloquium Berlin, with six different, wholly fresh         soundtracks, respectively in English, German, French, Swedish, Spanish,         and Hebrew accompanying the same footage. The Great Jewish Cemetery of         Berlin (Weissensee) is seen as the principal surviving evocation of the         greatest years (1860-1940) of German's principal city. In this visual         history, the Cemetery and its suggestive gravestones become an archaeological         window into a Berlin, not only Jewish, that, alas, no longer exists. The         visual track has current scenes from the Cemetery. On the soundtrack is         the authentic testimony of ex-Berliners remembering the Cemetery and the         world represented there. Since the gravestones already provide so much         to read, we chose not to sub-title the film (or to allow the affectations         of overdubbing), but, instead, used the more authentic, if unusual, principle         of reproducing the film with wholly new soundtracks composed from fresh         interviews with ex-Berliners. Not only because the soundtracks differ         in content, but because the imagery begs to be reseen, our recommendation         is that, especially for sophisticated audiences, at least two versions         be seen in sequence. (For the films other than English, we can provide         printed sheets of rough translations.). The films have been screened on         my personal tours where I also answer questions about it and Weissensee.         These 21' films are available in 16 mm optical track, 16 mm magnetic track,         3/4" U-Matic cassettes (both NTSC and PAL) and 1/2" VHS cassettes, for         rental or purchase. Koerber, along with Michael Maassen and myself, also         produced a 65-minute radio feature <b>Nach Weissensee</b> that has been         broadcast over German stations and favorably reviewed in the German press.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Epiphanies</b>         (1981-93). On the soundtrack are heard my single-sentence stories that         are meant to be the epiphanies, or resonant, illuminating moments of otherwise         nonexistent fictions. Read by numerous voices, these stories have no ostensible         connection to each other, other than similarity in esthetic kind, and         no ostensible connection either to the visual track which has unconnected         clips of various lengths that have the same epiphanic quality. What results         from these abundant collection of visual and verbal stories is the exhaustive         experience of the experience of fiction. This film, in progress for several         years now, is available in several forms. 1.) Footage, 29:35, presently         without sound, which can be played in conjunction with audiotapes in either         English or German. This is available on both 16 mm film and 3/4" NTSC         U-Matic cassettes. 2.) A 20-minute U-Matic NTSC cassette of a different         version (whose film no longer exists), with an entirely German soundtrack.         3.) A four-hour videotape that is available on VHS or U-Matic cassettes         with a fixed soundtrack mostly in English but including some parts in         German, Chinese, and Vietnamese. 4.) A series of 10 to 20-minute films         that could be printed, support willing, with soundtracks in either English         or German; these would work best as a sort of nonserial serial shown in         conjunction with a sequence of other films in a standard projection venue.         My own recommendation is that the longest version would work best with         an audience that could leave and return to it, say as an installation         in a museum or a public space.. Various versions of Epiphanies have been         screened at the Arsenal (West Berlin), the Donnell Library (NYC), the         Anthology Film Archives, and over the North German television network.         This can also be shown with the videotape realization of Epiphanies in         which the stories appear on the television screen in various typographical         arrangements produced by me on an electronic character-generator.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Constructivist         Fictions</b> (1978). Symmetrical line-drawings, seen in negative, change         in systemic sequence. The system informing these changes may be additive,         reductive, permutational or combinational, among other syntactic techniques.         One recurring theme is variation and development within a systemic constraint.         Produced in collaboration with Peter Longauer, now a well-known commercial         animator, with a soundtrack by the composer Jon Gibson, this film was         made on an animation stand, but is unlike any animation seen before. For         images this draws upon two of my books of visual fiction: <i>Constructs</i>         (WCPR, 1975) and <i>Constructs Two</i> (Membrane, 1978). 5:30 in length,         it is available on 16 mm optical track and a 3/4" NTSC U-Matic cassette.         This film has been screened at Global Village and the 25th Festival Mondial         du Cinema de Courts Metrages (1985), where it received an honorable mention         in the "Classe Independant."</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> <b>Openings & Closings</b>         (1976-78). Single-sentence stories are either the openings or the closings         of otherwise nonexistent fictions. All that appears on the screen are         the words, with the openings as black letters on a white background and         the closings as white letters on a black background. Since the soundtrack         has continuous classical piano, the film evokes recollection of silent         movies and, within that context, could be considered "all titles, no action."         This draws for its text upon my book of the same title (D'Arc, 1975).         15:30 in length, this film, made in collaboration with Barton Weiss, has         been screened at the University of Texas, Global Village (NYC), Anthology         Film Archives (NYC), Hamline College (St. Paul), and the Western Front         (Vancouver), among other places. It and Constructivist Fictions also toured         with <i>Wordsand</i> (1978), a traveling retrospective of my work with         words, numbers and lines, in several media.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> "When we say expanded         cinema, we actually mean expanded consciousness. Expanded cinema does         not mean computer films, video phosphors, atomic light or spherical projections.         Expanded cinema isn't a movie at all: like life it's a process of becoming,         man's ongoing historical drive to manifest his consciousness outside of         his mind, in front of his eyes. One no longer can specialize in a single         discipline and hope truthfully to express a clear picture of its relationships         in the environment."--Gene Youngblood,<i> Expanded Cinema</i> (1970).</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Films in progress,         seeking support, include "New York City," a montage of images unique to         my hometown, fused to a 140' electro-acoustic tape composition of the         same title (that expands an earlier, shorter tape of the same title, initially         produced for Westdeutscher Rundfunk) and "Invocations," a universe of         sacred images, to complement the remixed version of another electro-acoustic         composition, 60 minutes long, broadcast by public stations around the         world and currently available, in an unrevised form, on a Folkways record.         Both projects are meant to explore Moholy-Nagy's vision of "a true opto-acoustic         synthesis in the sound film. ... The 'documentary sound film' and the         'abstract sound film' will be reinforced by the 'montage sound film',         by which must be understood not merely montage of the optical and acoustic         sections, but a mutually integrated montage of both. We ought to begin         with a series of experiments in the sound element."</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> Longauer and myself         are also working on "A Life in New York City," likewise proposed to be         60 minutes long, that would resemble the Berlin films in regarding current         architecture as reflective of past life, in this case my own, to my narration.         Related work includes books, videotapes, audiotapes, and holograms, some         of which complement the films.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> For more information         about any of these, please write me.</font></p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
