Whereas most erotic writing   is about one thing, this is meant to be about everything. Periodical editors   are invited to select the ones they wish to publish. These individual stories   can then be run in whatever order an editor prefers. Please allow in the design   and typography sufficient space (or distance) to establish that these are separate   stories, with no particular connection to one another, other than common subject.   My own recommendation would be that the designer use different typefaces for   adjacent stories and, better yet, that blocks of type be floated in the space   of the page (or the magazine column). Another suggestion is that a periodical   interested in using a good deal of the text consider publishing their selections   as a kind of serial, with, say, a dozen or two dozen stories in each successive   issue, the whole thus functioning as a continuous feature to which readers would   immediately turn as they open each new issue. Stories from Lovings may be published   as well as a book of similar design. Beyond that, these Lovings could, with   the aid of a sophisticated character-generator, also become the content of a   cable television program or the base of a feature-length film. (Producers interested   in this last possibility should contact the author for more specific details.)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> At all costs I wanted   to avoid any resemblance with a love story. My conviction is that the well-made   love story, with a beginning, an end, and a crises in the middle, is the way   society proposes that the lover should reconcile himself with the language of   their great Orpheus. . . . So, it's a discontinuous book which protests in a   small way against the [traditional] love story.--Roland Barthes, in an interview   (4 April 1977) </font></p></body></html>
