My quarrel   with it begins with the title. Black is the color of anarchism; red belongs   to Communism. Emma was an anarchist, a profound anarchist, who, were she alive,   surely would have objected to Schulman's title. My selection would emphasize   her feminist writings, her pioneering critique from the anarchist left of Soviet   Russia, and her literary excellences. It would include healthy chucks from My   Disillusionment in Russia (1924), which was last reprinted in 1970; and My Futher   Disillusionment with Russia (1926). It would include essays never before reprinted,   such as "Woman Without a Country." I might completely avoid reprinting from   Living My Life (1930), her renowned autobiography, which has long been in print.   I regard The Great American Person of Radical Letters as a companions to Gertrude   Stein anthologies I have done. Whereas Stein is featured in literature courses,   so Goldman belongs in sociology, feminism, and literary criticism courses. As   before, I'm prepared to write a strong appreciative preface and to edit to whatever   length the publisher determines, as long as my interpretation of Goldman as   a black (not red) anarchist-feminist is respected. Publishers wishing to know   more should please contact me at the addresses at the top of this page. Thanks.   </font> </p></body></html>
