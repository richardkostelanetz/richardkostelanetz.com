For this audiotape composition I plan to record at least one hundred   New Yorkers, saying "I was born in New York City in [year]" and then adding   where their parents came from, in what neighborhoods they grew up, where they   went to schools, etc. My expectation is that from these field recordings I will   compose a piece of speech-music that will begin as a sequence of solos, ordered   not only for chronological exposition and sociological intelligence but for   sonic values. I imagine that voices will quickly come up over each other (as   New Yorkers are wont to do), from different parts of the stereo spectrum; but   before long, they will be heard speaking in duets, electronically mixed and   steophonically arrayed, and then trios, quartets, and quintets, as I hope to   find in choral arrangements a New York City sound that would not be so audible   in one voice alone. There is no need to use any acoustic processing or any sounds   other than native voices. I envision a multitrack piece that would be at least   thirty and perhaps sixty minutes long. <b>I Was Born in New York City</b> will   hopefully take its place beside other extended audiotapes of mine that were   composed of and about the sound of a certain subject--baseball (1986), <i>New   York City</i> (1984), the Jewish diaspora (1990) and the language of prayer   (1981); and if this new piece turns out as well as its predecessors, it will   probably be broadcast around the world and perhaps released as well on record   or cassette. No matter how long it takes to make the source tapes, I would need   a few months to consider the raw tapes and perhaps forty hours in multitrack   studio to compose it. Institutions interested in supporting this project should   contact me at the address at the top of this page. Thank you. </font> </p></body></html>
