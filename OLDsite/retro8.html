Balanchine once said the perfect type plot for a dramatic narrative ballet was the story of the Prodigal Son. Once there was a man who had everything, then he had nothing; finally he had everything again.--Lincoln Kirstein, <I>Ballet Alphabet</I> (1939)</P><P>Our action on behaviour, linked with other desirable aspects of a revolution in mores, can be briefly defined as the invention of games of an essentially new type. The most general goal must be to extend the non-mediocre part of life, to reduce the empty moments of life as much as possible.--Situationist International, "Definitions" (1958)</P><P>CLOSET DRAMA: A play (sometimes called a dramatic poem) designed to be read rather than performed. The term may also apply to a play which was intended to be performed but hardly ever is, and yet has survived as a piece of worthwhile literature.--J. A. Cuddon, <I>A Dictionary of Literary Terms</I> (third edition, 1991)</P><P>&#9;A deposed monarch, working in exile as a laborer under an assumed name, befriends a draft deserter who falls in love with the sometime monarch's beautiful daughter. Asked by the current monarch if his predecessor might be hiding in Another Country, the chief of the secret police identifies the draft deserter, falsely reasoning that any laboring man who successfully woos such a beautiful woman must indeed be a king-in-disguise. The deserter is arrested, in a flurry of publicity, while his sometime friend, the former king, slips away.</P><P>&#9;The head of a pirate band disrupts an island wedding and forces the Count's daughter to abandon her fianc&eacute; for him. As this new betrothal is celebrated, the pirate leader places a ring on a small statue of his former wife and is surprised to see her stone fingers close over the ring possessively. Resisting all pleas to cancel the ceremony, the pirate reveals that he is really the Count's brother and thus likewise of royal lineage. The sometime pirate arrests the Count and orders the statue of his wife to be thrown into the sea, while the daughter seeks sanctuary in a church sooner than marry her long-lost uncle. Attempting to drag the daughter away from the church, the pirate is instead dragged beneath the waves by the indomitable statue that still holds the ring. The marriage originally planned is consummated.</P><P>&#9;A favorite concubine of the dictator pities two imprisoned deserters and secretly provides them with sufficient money to bribe their guards. A disgruntled junior minister facilitates their escape. When the pair is captured, they implicate the concubine instead of the man who saved them. The dictator does what authoritarians customarily do with those who violate their total rule.</P><P>&#9;The prima ballerina returns to the dressing room where the other female dancers, angry about not only her show-stealing but her unexpected departures from the script, set upon her viciously.</P><P>&#9;On a large blackboard three performers write messages of love to one another one letter at a time, backwards.</P><P>&#9;Set in the control tower of a small airport, this ballet portrays the anxieties and relationships of the flight controllers with the dancers flying gliders or hooked into self-propelled harnesses.</P><P>&#9;A young man, engaged to a young woman of a higher class, goes abroad to seek a sufficient fortune. Entering an alien underworld that he finds attractive, the young man forgets about his fianc&eacute;, who dies of neglect. When the young man walks through a sleeping town that he comes to recognize as his home, he inadvertently steps on her grave and is confronted by her ghost. Witches dance around him as he drops dead at their feet.</P><P>Adult crash kiddie cars into one other until all but one is disabled.</P><P>&#9;An ordinary soldier is lectured by his Captain, who despises him. Gathering sticks with his girlfriend, with whom he has fathered a young daughter, the soldier is alarmed by strange sounds and visions. The girlfriend flirts at a party with a passing military musician. The soldier is examined by an incompetent doctor who, his professional insufficiencies notwithstanding, seduces the soldier's girlfriend. The Captain teases the soldier with accusations of his girlfriend's infidelity. The soldier finds her kissing the musician and accuses her. When the musician boasts of his success, the soldier beats him. Though his girlfriend is reading the Bible, the soldier stabs her by a pond, into which he throws his murder weapon. Wading into the pond to retrieve the murder weapon (and, by extension, the memory of his lover), he accidentally drowns. The daughter born of their union initially doesn't understand what is meant when older children tell her that her parents are dead.</P><P>&#9;Contemporary Ballets consists only of a large message screen, probably a liquid crystal display, on which appear the texts published here.</P><P>&#9;A neurotic young man loves a woman who reciprocates, though she is officially engaged to his older friend. Stepping aside, the younger man years later returns from business abroad to find the woman still married to his older friend. She urges him again to leave her for life abroad. On hearing from a gossip that he has purchased a gun, she rushes to his hotel room and finds that he has killed himself.</P><P>&#9;The evening is spent waiting for someone named Godot and perhaps his entourage to appear.</P><P>&#9;Onto an empty stage, up through the trap doors, come scores of performers, filling the stage so densely that they begin to push one another into the audience.</P><P>&#9;Finding that her lover, nominally a schoolmaster, has accidentally killed a cat owned by a mafia capo, a woman volunteers to intercede for him, taking responsibility for the accident. Though the schoolmaster at first discourages her, she insists, because, unbeknownst to him, she is the capo's niece. Entranced by the niece he has not seen in years, the capo wants to introduce her to his henchman and excuse her from killing the cat in the course of coercing her to become engaged to someone else. Hysterically wanting to escape from a circumstance so distasteful, she tells the truth about the cat's death; both she and her lover are killed by the henchman.</P><P>&#9;Several performers repeatedly fall to the floor and push themselves up until all of them can rise no more.</P><P>&#9;Onto the stage comes a man who leaps into the air, where he hangs suspended as dancers dressed as stagehands mill around the stage wondering how to bring him back down, until curtains are closed.</P><P>&#9;A prince, falling in love with a blacksmith's daughter, courts her in both his own person and disguised as an apprentice blacksmith. When she tells the prince that she really loves the apprentice, the blacksmith disapproves, because he wants his daughter to marry the prince's principal man-servant. When the servant identifies himself as homosexual, the daughter is allowed to marry the apprentice, who reveals his true royal identity.</P><P>&#9;A chorus of leprechauns poke at one another, apparently trying to discover who among them might be an imposter, which is to say a person.</P><P>&#9;A young man, saved from death at the hands of three hoodlums, believes his rescuer to be instead a garbageman, who is in turn harassed by the hoodlums for lying. Happening to see a picture of the hoodlums' sister, the young man falls in love. The hoodlums' mother tells of her daughter's capture by yet another hoodlum. To facilitate her rescue, the young man is given a magic flute and the garbageman magic bells. The daughter is guarded by a dumb servant who, mistaking the garbageman for the devil, flees. The young man learns that the purported kidnapper is really a good guy; it's the hoodlums' mother who is evil. The garbageman and the girl are prevented from escaping until the garbageman's bells, no joke, cause the kidnapper to dance helplessly. Now free of encumbrances, the young people are able to marry.</P><P>&#9;A music-hall singer has an affair with a philanderer on a pristine beach before returning to her bartender lover.</P><P>&#9;A military officer makes his girlfriend a Vestal Virgin while he is fighting abroad. Upon his return home, he breaks into the temple to win her back. As she allows the holy fire to be extinguished, she is condemned to death. When she is led to her execution, a flash of lightning rekindles the fire. Spared from death, she rejoins her main man.</P><P>&#9;This ballet follows Homer's account of Odysseus's return after the Trojan wars and tells, in a series of flashbacks, of his sexual encounters abroad.</P><P>&#9;An hereditary vampire can satisfy Satan only with the sacrifice of three young women within twenty-four hours. He thinks the first killed, but does not know that she is revived supernaturally in the moonlight through the help of the vampire's assistant. He successfully seduces and kills a second, whose fault is a fascination with vampires, and nearly succeeds in claiming his third victim until she is successfully rescued by the first woman.</P><P>&#9;Two athletic male dancers do triple jet&eacute;s in alternation until one of them can jump no more.</P><P>&#9;One performer appears to negotiate a series of mazes whose walls must be precisely mapped in his mind because they are invisible to the audience.</P><P>&#9;A shady businessman wanting to impress young women is continually pulling shiny gold bars out of his jacket pockets; the women in turn, one after the other, each draw baby crocodiles out from under their skirts.</P><P>&#9;Ice hockey is played not with a standard puck but a whiffleball.</P><P>&#9;While spasms of circumscribed movement break out among isolated groups crouching around the stage, the protagonist, surrounded by an entourage, makes expansive movements that apparently consecrate the ground. Maidens enter, looking anxious, as though programmed to participate in an undesirable fate. An orgy ensues until the maidens' anger transcends their religious humility. How this conflict is resolved is left to the discretion of the choreographer.</P><P>&#9;Two young lovers, sunbathing nude on an ocean island, sink beneath a rising tide.</P><P>&#9;Several performers vigorously play nothing on familiar instruments, making a ballet of their moves over the sound of their physical efforts.</P><P>&#9;A large man spits directly on his enemies, apparently blinding each of them in a single eye. They spit back, to no avail, while the protagonist stands apart, stoically satisfied.</P><P>&#9;Several pairs of men, dressed to resemble roosters, imitate as closely as possible the mechanics of a cockfight while the spectators are invited to make bets.</P><P>&#9;Two men run in place, with microphones amplifying their breathing and their pounding feet, until the pace of their increasingly heavy breaths becomes quicker than the beat of their footfalls.</P><P>&#9;One performer mimes as closely as possible the moves and dress of another directly opposite him, as though the former inhabited a slightly delayed mirror.</P><P>&#9;The performers scan the audience for past loves. Finding none from the stage, they venture out in the audience, looking for any reasonable semblances.</P><P>&#9;Several performers fire guns at one another and become increasingly frustrated when they have no visible effect.</P><P>&#9;From springboards on both sides of the stage performers soar through the air in crossing directions, landing behind side curtains that are eventually pushed aside to reveal trampoline-like nets.</P><P>&#9;Drown.</P><P>&#9;From various points in the audience bushels of ripe tomatoes are thrown directly at two naked performers who try as hard as they can to catch the fruit, eventually cover the performers&#146; private parts. Once all the tomatoes have been thrown, the performers must clean the stage, though not themselves, back to its pristine condition.</P><P>&#9;A credible man becomes a credible woman by any means available without ever leaving the stage.</P><P>&#9;Four performers, initially suspended head down by their feet, try to crawl up the ropes that are holding them until all of them disappear behind the top of the proscenium.</P><P>&#9;A group of skilled mechanics completely take apart a car (or another complicated machine) and then put it back together, regardless of whether any spectators stay to the conclusion.</P><P>&#9;A woman disappears behind the door, center stage, where to the sound of giving birth two adult-sized daughters emerge. After dancing for a while in front of the door, they too go behind it and, to the sound of giving birth, each daughter generating her own set of adult daughters, who in turn dance in front of the door, etc., until the producers expire the pool of available performers.</P><P>&#9;Make any move or moves that will prompt most of the audience to exclaim "incredible, incredible."</P><P>From above the curtain stage right emerges a figure that falls on a trampoline that propels him high above the curtain stage left from which emerges another figure that falls on the trampoline and move upwards stage right for as long as the audience stays.</P><P>In a ballet better suited to the technical capabilities of television, several dancers appear to be walking through a rainstorm that changes to a snowstorm, though nothing visible falls on their heads.</P><P>&#9;Well before the performance of purportedly erotic dancing is meant to begin, the auditorium is filled with a disagreeable odor that drives out all but those who cannot smell. No one should apologize for the odor, while the person selling tickets should conveniently disappear.</P><P>&#9;Above a sleeping young man expands and contracts a balloon whose skin reads "riches, women, and power."</P><P>&#9;Several experienced jugglers toss baseballs until one is dropped, at which point that weaker juggler leaves the stage. The other jugglers continue. The piece ends when all the jugglers have crashed.</P><P>&#9;A group of women drive kiddie cars resembling those found at amusement parks. They crash into each other until their cars are disabled or they run out of fuel.</P><P>&#9;While three performers execute whatever traditional balletic movements they wish toward the back of the stage, two men, appropriately garbed, have a serious fencing match in the front of the stage.</P><P>&#9;Several performers along with available props behave as though they were caught in a tornado.</P><P>&#9;On the back wall of the theater are posted instructions for physical movements that correspond to the numbers two through twelve. With each throw of a pair of dice, one or more of the performers execute the prescribed movement(s). The more dice that are used, the more throws that are made, perhaps by members of the audience, often simultaneously, the more densely kinetic the stage activities become.</P><P>&#9;A number of skunks are let onto the stage one at a time.</P><P>&#9;Several performers try to mime the movements suggested by the most dissonant, abrasive contemporary music available. While the music ends, they leave the stage.</P><P>&#9;A glamorous young skinny woman, resembling a runway model, tries as hard as she can, by any means possible, to resemble a butch lesbian before leaving the stage.</P><P>&#9;Onto the stage come bulls, or other imposing animals, whose presence drives the audience to the exits.</P><P>&#9;Five Chihuahuas race in low-walled tracks from one side of the stage to the other. The first dog to win five races gets a well-deserved prize of more food than it can eat.</P><P>&#9;Several performers on stage follow with their index fingers the trajectory of imaginary objects above the spectators' heads.</P><P>&#9;Two teams of naked performers, each with three members whose bodies are painted from head to toe in the same color, play two-handed touch football with a balloon that must be deposited intact on the other side of the stage to register as a score.</P><P>&#9;In this performer-less ballet, a machine generates chartreuse suds that fill the stage and flood the audience that is forced to evacuate the theater.</P><P>&#9;As spectators begin to exit early, disappointed that the scheduled performance has not yet begun, they are waived along by sneering performers waiting in the lobby.</P><P>&#9;Performers come up the aisles, producing small pornographic photographs that they ask spectators to pass carefully from seat to seat down the rows. If one photo fails to arrive at the end of its row, the performers collect the remaining images and exit through the lobby.</P><P>&#9;What to all appearances resembles a puppet is suddenly revealed to be a man.</P><P>&#9;Several naked performers jump successively off a stepladder or platform into an aquarium whose water, perhaps including fish, spills over the stage and perhaps into the audience.</P><P>&#9;Several performers dressed only with flypaper hug one another until they become a single blob of humanity incapable of movement.</P><P>&#9;As many women as can be made available look and sound as though they are giving birth, though no babies appear. (The performers could include men capable of executing the choreographic instruction.)</P><P>&#9;On stage are as many chess matches as can be accommodated. The performance ends when the last match is finished, regardless of whether anyone remains in the audience. (This is best performed in a theater whose audience sits high above the stage, like a chemistry laboratory, rather than on a platform physically above an audience.)</P><P>&#9;A man falling from behind the top curtain brakes in mid-air, never touching the floor. Once applause ends, curtains are closed, forever hiding the secret.</P><P>&#9;When a young woman appears in her nightgown at the door of a local hotel, her fianc&eacute; renounces her in public; but when he finds her sleepwalking over to his own house, he escorts her, apparently still asleep, directly to the church, with the hope that once they reside together, the woman's somnambulating will cease.</P><P>No matter where the protagonist goes on stage or elsewhere in the theater, a narrowly focused rain shower falls on his head.</P><P>Out of a single small car languidly emerge two dogs, three goats, four sheep, and five people.</P><P>A young woman albino living in a northern climate falls in love with a man from a sunny country; and once she follows him home, she tragically succumbs to a sunstroke, melting away much like the snow-maiden of traditional myth.</P><P>Meant to be a parable of masochism, this ballet confines several athletic performers to a single space open at the front but otherwise five feet on each side.</P><P>The Baseball Game is a ballet divided into nine sections that the program note calls innings. The large company is divided into two groups, each with nine dancers. Each performance has such variable results that stagehands can be observed going through motions that resemble the making of wagers.</P><P>The princess goes from her father's coronation to join her true love at his home, a cave in the woods.</P><P>A woman tells of her sister and alter ego, a dancer who tours seven American cities to earn sufficient money to build a house for her family back home; in each city she mimics a different tempting sin.</P><P>Two dancers who should be rehearsing instead don successive masks of familiar movie stars and imitate physical mannerisms peculiar to each.</P><P>In an unannounced performance on a green lawn, twenty-eight dancers, dressed in slightly different shades of green, blend into the natural surroundings as they move about.</P><P>Surplus/B-Sides, an anthology of disconnected sequences that a fecund choreographer could not use in his previous ballets, is performed continuously in the aisles while his major works are presented on the stage.</P><P>While a young man, lying on a warm beach, picks up a conch shell to discover its sound, a sea nymph, watching him from her hiding place, emerges to meet him, and the dance they do together resembles coition in the buoyancy of water.</P><P>In an entr'acte resembling a television commercial, the development of the prima dancers is portrayed through showing first beginning children at the barre, then adolescents in class, and finally soloists exhibiting their bravura techniques, against a continuous background of their eating a proper dancer's diet.</P><P>A young man, unhappily engaged to marry a woman chosen for him, succumbs instead to a lady drug dealer and her exotic potions.</P><P>The solo dancer portrays, through a series of highly emotional movements, the desires and thus frustrations of women left at home while their men are away at war.</P><P>This ballet portrays a mysterious fertility rite in which first an old bitch dog and then a young woman are sacrificed on a surrogate phallus.</P><P>The protracted conflict between two feuding families is resolved when a grandmother of one falls in love with a grandfather in another and, realizing what problems their relationship makes, the septuagenarians commit suicide together, prompting a reconciliation over the tombs of the star-crossed lovers--a tragically "happy" end.</P><P>Summoning back to life several nuns who had violated their vows, our wicked protagonist gets them to dance with him, first clothed and then nude.</P><P>The cowboys working on a ranch flirt with every woman within sight until their boss dies. The successor is his daughter whom, as their employer, they must respect. (Now they flirt with every women except one.)</P><P>This ballet portrays not courtship but the diffidence of a man and a woman in the wake of an emotional and sexual relationship, apparently of some duration.</P><P>Three male performers, roughly twenty, forty, and sixty, represent generational differences in dealing with worldly opportunities, including women, jobs, art, politics, and religion.</P><P>Two young people flirt, embrace, and make love in a changing landscape of projected images from classic paintings.</P><P>The young female protagonist gives her life to save the leader of a crowd of revolutionaries from an assassin's bullet, thus becoming a heroine immortalized in song and, here, in a dance that reenacts the fateful moments in several ways and at different speeds.</P><P>In a dance lasting at least twenty years, a company of a dozen performers do things they would normally do.</P><P>From a group of women, imprisoned on an island during a civil war, emerges a handsome peasant girl who becomes, successively, a representative of her peers and then, thanks to her sexual attractiveness, their leader in attempting to get back to the mainland.</P><P>Several individuals, representing various sexual persuasions, attempt to comfort one another in a socially encroaching world.</P><P>When a woman who fears she might lose her lover to her younger sister gives herself to a stranger, whom she finds disgusting, her lover accepts her apology, responding with sympathy and understanding.</P><P>Several escaped prisoners, living in a remote forest, survive on captured butterflies for nourishment until one of the prisoners suffers hallucinations and thinks that he has become a butterfly.</P><P>This contemporary adaptation of the Adam and Eve story introduces more possibilities for that mystical seduction than generations of exegetes had ever considered.</P><P>The owner of a puppet theater brings to life his favorite female dancer, his favorite clown, and his favorite strong man, only to discover that the clown falls in love with the ballerina who prefers the strong man who, dummy that he was, kills the clown.</P><P>In Pas de trois the dancers, each of a different sexual persuasion, do the erotic moves normally done by two.</P><P>On stage is brought an upright piece of ice, roughly the size of a coffin, that, as dancers chant and stomp around it, proceeds to defrost, revealing the annointed leader of the people.</P><P>A young man wanting a career in law enforcement proves his mettle, in spite of his grandfather's warnings, by single-handedly capturing a notorious criminal who mugged his grandmother.</P><P>An artist admiring intently, for days without sleep, a painting of the Holy Family eventually identifies himself with Christ on the cross.</P><P>In one of his opium dreams, the sleeping choreographer meets an angel who introduces him to other dancers already resident in ballet heaven. To initiate him into their different world, the other dancers imitate poorly his signature moves.</P><P>Imitating the kinds of movement typical of roller skaters, the dancers in bare feet enact various kinds of kinetic trysts.</P><P>A group of Greek gods and goddesses, each with his or her name emblazoned on both the front and back of sweatshirts, reenacts choreographically several classic stories simultaneously.</P><P>Two children of quarreling farmers meet at school and fall in love, necessarily leaving their homes, though underage. They secretly board a barge heading downstream, hiding beneath sacks of grain harvested from their families' farms. When it sinks, they die.</P><P>A group of basketball players, locked out of their stadium in a contractual dispute, entertain their fans (and get media attention, while embarrassing their bosses) by displaying their virtuosity on city streets.</P><P>As the curtain opens, its moorings at the top begin to crack, the curtain falling down onto the stage in a clumsy heap, leaving the platform otherwise bare and the audience justifiably angry.</P><P>Two impresarios try to steal each other's dancers, in full view of each other.</P><P>Among the guests at a party honoring a prima ballerina is a young man who falls in love with her and she with him; but as she recalls former lovers, who dress to resemble one another, she realizes that not only is this new suitor beneath her standards but that the policy of loving men she has simply had enough.</P><P>Inspired by birdlike movements, this ballet is essentially plotless.</P><P>The girls of a port town find the ship captain so irresistable that they disguise themselves as beardless young sailors to board his ship, where they discover, as he makes advances on them, that the captain must be essentially homosexual.</P><P>Two prisoners escape to the home of one whose wife falls in love with the other, who is persuaded to kill her husband but then, under the persistent threat of arrest, he remains hidden in her house, eventually realizing that he has simply exchanged one prison for another, the new one only slightly less disagreeable than its predecessor.</P><P>Several performers, as naked as acceptable, smear one another with chocolate syrup whose smell becomes so overwhelming that chocolate-hungry members of the audience on their own initiative come on stage to lick spatulas and even the performers' bodies. (Their needs should not be spurned.)</P><P>A man with an easily divisible personality is torn severely between body and soul, convention and dissidence, wealth and love; his role can be played by two or more dancers.</P><P>In an apartment too large for two people, an attractive young woman tries in vain to get more attention from a husband who is more devoted to cocaine.</P><P>A beautiful young girl who loses her virginity prior to marriage is turned into a butterfly, which may or may not in the end represent a punishment.</P><P>An American college girl marries a handsome foreign student who could not otherwise stay in the States, incidentally hoping he will eventually love her.</P><P>The assassins who appear to be male turn out to be women.</P><P>In this updated version of the Orpheus legend, a matinee idol, publicly known as homosexual, descends into hell in search of a favorite lover who recently died from AIDS.</P><P>A military nurse saves the life of an enemy officer, who falls in love with her, and she with he; but before they can make their affection public, they must overcome numerous obstacles that are both official and unofficial.</P><P>Though from all appearances she looked like a contemporary woman, the prima donna was also a skilled automotive mechanic.</P><P>An athletic woman who tries repeatedly to do four jet&eacute;s in mid-air finally succeeds, disappearing above the proscenium.</P><P>In an all-night performance, several dancers represent the planets slowly rotating around the sun, whose role is played by the choreographer.</P><P>Thanks to effects possible with videotape, we see on the small screen a man, obviously exhausted, continually climbing upwards to heaven and repeatedly passing a sign marked only with an infinity symbol.</P><P>On the white classic leotards of scores of dancers are projected both radical contemporary political slogans and abstract lines resembling the tread marks of radial tires.</P><P>The spook of a murdered woman returns to dance with her husband, who, in honor of the occasion, suddenly appears twenty years younger.</P><P>All available spotlights are shined directly at the audience, preferably in steadily increasing number, until everyone leaves.</P><P>Among small slender women rehearsing gymnastic routines moves a stocky man holding a television camera devoid of extending wires.</P><P>A prostitute enslaved by a demonic pimp is required to murder her customers until she encounters a man who, even though he is stabbed many times, does not die.</P><P>When a prophecy made by a psychic proves to be false, disappointed and disgusted dancers throw him into the orchestra pit.</P><P>In a black mass, with three archangels presiding, a young woman makes a Faustian wager, transforming herself, thanks to angelic hocus-pocus, into the contemporary embodiment of excessive knowledge--a hard computer disc that lies under a spotlight at the center of the stage.</P><P>The protagonist is someone, apparently a dance patron, for whom everyone is continually waiting, even though he or she doesn't appear.</P><P>In a ballet accompanied by primitive music, a devilish young woman, dancing with extravagant movements, strangles prospective suitors with her extended ponytail.</P><P>During an hour of continuous movement, a game of musical chairs evolves into a brawl that requires the intervention of the police.</P><P>When a pilot who dies in an ocean crash returns to his fianc&eacute;e as a ghost, she agrees to follow him to his submarine cave, where they are wed. Consummation becomes impossible, given their inhabiting different realms, until she too becomes a ghost.</P><P>An older choreographer defines the current style of his art by performing selected passages from his earlier works, as well as describing with both words and movements in loving detail those he is physically no longer able to do.</P><P>The protagonist falls into an epileptic fit when her father tells her to marry someone other than the man she loves, and she has even more extravagant fits when her father offers yet other suitors.</P><P>According to the program, "The purpose of this ballet is to represent male-female relationships realistically--as harmonious as they should be."</P><P>From over two dozen famous classic ballets this dance called Inventory, really the epitome of compilation choreography, takes phrases familiar to all dance lovers.</P><P>Before any human performers appear, water floods onto the stage and out into the audience which is forced to leave. Their commotion becomes the ballet.</P><P>An imperious woman employer gives a young man marijuana, which he brazenly shares not with his employer but with another employee, female, prompting his summary dismissal.</P><P>A pretty farm girl, abducted by the brother of the county's agribusiness mogul, awakens in a house graced by a life-sized statue of the mogul. After much confusion and explanation, she consents to stay with the brother.</P><P>Two women mount bicyles at the back corner of the stage and, as they ride forward, crash into each other.</P><P>On a cruise in the Caribbean, the protagonist's girlfriend is swept overboard, fortunately near the shore. As the ship's crew is unable to find her in circling around the sea, he leaves the cruise, going from fishing village to village until, to everyone's surprise, he finds her.</P><P>The protagonist stakes all he has, including his wife, on a sports wager that he loses.</P><P>In this urban horse opera, a beautiful girl is enslaved by a homosexual who exploits her to attract men whom he then rapes and, if they threaten to report him to the police, murders unrepentently until one of his intended victims draws a gun in return, killing the rapist and falsely assuring the girl that she is free, all while making plays in an aside to enslave her for his own purposes.</P><P>A man new to a town finds lodging with a widow who finds him desirable and her daughter whom he desires instead.</P><P>In this war between two gangs of young people, a girl belonging to one gang causes a street war when, to escape an oncoming car, she hops on the back of the other gangleader's motorcycle.</P><P>Before a projection of a bombed-out city, the dancers construct a tent from urban scrap.</P><P>In this version of Alice in Wonderland, all the dancers working in a studio conspire to crash into a mirror that, when it breaks, becomes a doorway to another world.</P><P>Christ is reborn in an urban slum, experiencing again, after a period of miraculous good deeds, a crucifixion and resurrection whose significance is apparent not to those around him but to the audience.</P><P>This dance suggests, wholly through movements, events culminating in the assassination of our President.</P><P>Several dancers perform sequences of intrinsically arbitrary movements, pausing between the sections. None of the movements has any intrinsic meaning or any connection to the others--in sum asking the audience to find relations and coherences that might not exist.</P><P>Two visibly muscular athletes play tennis with a whiffleball.</P><P>On a large piece of thick paper tacked to the stage's back wall, several artists of both sexes draw certain spectators whose bodies are imagined to be nude.</P><P>As many performers as are available exchange clothes with one another, regardless of differences in size and gender, including underwear, so that each piece of clothing is worn (or at least touched) by every performer before returning to its original owner. The piece ends with everyone dressed as they began.</P><P>Several performers whisper secrets into one another's ears until everyone in the audience leaves the space; only then may they speak aloud.</P><P>After the house lights darken to blackness, the auditorium becoming as dark as the blackest night, the curtain rises on an equally dark stage which may or may not have performers. The only perceptions that can be made are the sounds of human beings making love.</P><I><P>War Games</I> is a mechanical ballet improvised by several children manning self-propelled toy tanks.</P><P>While a clock with a large audible second-hand clicks on the stage, several performers climb from the stage in and out of the orchestra pit as many times as possible within five minutes.</P><P>On stage is a mountain of fresh ice cream, which audience members are given spoons to eat, a few at a time, until the ice cream melts away.</P><P>Spectators are encouraged to come up to the stage to participate in an auction in which they become amanuenses for a day.</P><P>Soon after the curtain rises, a large number of portable alarm clocks begin to ring--at least one hundred, perhaps two--forcing the sole protagonist to turn each one off until the stage becomes silent. Only then can he or she hear, let alone accept, the audience's congratulations.</P><P>At a zoo caged camels spoke cigarettes elegantly.</P><P>One of two performers lights candles with a match while the other blows them out. As one relights the extinguished candles, the off-on process continues until the performers, the audience, or the candles are exhausted.</P><P>A shy girl who failed a dance audition is comforted by a boyfriend who has just been cut from the basketball team.</P><P>Out of a little car emerge, with attendant fanfare for each, over a dozen performers. (The kind of stunts that succeed so well in a large circus should be tried on a small stage, space permitting.)</P><P>Performers are instructed to swing from the stage ropes, even dropping and pulling backdrops, much as the Marx Brothers did in <I>A Night at the Opera</I>.</P><P>Two middle-distance runners compete in a one-mile race within the confines of a small stage. The audience is asked to count "laps" marking the completion of milestones of the distance.</P><P>In the deep pit theater of, say, a chemistry lab are large tables under which performers do things that cannot be seen by the audience above.</P><P>On the darkest possible stage, performers use flashlights to help them select from a pile of cards containing instructions. The lights are extinguished while the instruction is performed to completion. At that point flashlights go on and a new card is selected, repeating the process, which continues until the performers discover through the darkness that the audience has completely gone.</P><P>While dancers are performing classical ballets of their choice, the temperature within the theater plummets by at least twenty degrees centigrade.</P><P>One performer with a bicycle pump blows up the largest available balloon. On its interior surface are messages that become legible as it expands. When the balloon fills the stage or explodes, the performance ends.</P><P>Spectators are invited from the audience to attack a large male performer without using their hands, knees, feet, or teeth.</P><P>Fifty infants are left to play by themselves with a few props. Adults are permitted only to keep them safely on the stage.</P><P>To twenty-four silent dinner guests one hostess working alone serves a seven-course meal.</P><P>As the curtain opens, several performers behind a waist-high wall walk as though they are climbing stairs in unison. After a signal, they walk as though they are descending stairs. A second signal indicates that each pretends to climb or descend as he or she wishes, for as long as each wants. Upon a third signal they appear to climb again in unison until a fourth signal prompts them to descend in unison.</P><P>The protagonists move from three dimensions into four and then into five, six, . . .</P><P>Several skilled tumblers do a series of forward rolls through a hall of mirrors similar to that in Orson Welles' <I>Our Lady of Shanghai</I>, visually amplifying human bodies to intimidating proportions.</P><P>Doors in a row along a wall parallel to the audience open and close at random.</P><P>Three performers make a human pyramid which stands intact as three more men join them to increase the pyramid's dimensions to one over two over three. Four more men enter to increase the size of the pyramid. Then five, etc., until the producers run out of performers or the pyramid fills the performance space.</P><P>On the floor of the stage, invisible to the audience below, is a material that permits the dancers to slide across the stage, on their butts as well as their feet, as though they were performing on ice.</P><P>A pile of packing confetti is moved, one particle at a time, from one side of the stage to the other by as many performers as necessary.</P><P>From members of the audience a solo performer purchases simple things, such as cigarettes, subway tokens, or dollar bills, paying solely with pennies that must be counted out one by one.</P><P>Within a rink with only one circle of ropes, two women are boxing with soft gloves the size of basketballs, painted with circular objects that resemble male testicles.</P><P>The house lights remain on while the curtain opens on at least two dozen performers with binoculars turned upon the audience. When a performer spots someone whom he or she would like to meet, the performer comes off the stage and approaches the victim/beneficiary, offering the latter a fresh flower. The spectator may refuse the performer's offer. Ideally, each performer will have found a mate by the end of the piece. Should that not happen within a specified time, all earlier liaisons are terminated.</P><P>Eight doctors give comprehensive physical examinations to eight patients varying in age and sex.</P><P>The changing expression on the protagonist's face reveals that the stock certificates he is clutching to his chest have become more valuable in the course of the performance.</P><P>An automobile perched smack in the center of the stage begins to levitate only inches above the ground, wavering in anticipation of its eventual fall to earh.</P><P>The dancers don mundane clothes and eat lots of garlic before sitting in whatever seats remain empty in the theater. They read and drink libations until every member of the audience leaves. By simply sitting in place stubborn spectators may take revenge on the performers (but not on me as the absentee author, thankfully).</P><P>A romantic student rages against society and himself until fate, disguised in the form of a fellow student, lends a sympathetic hand, teaching the student the value of community.</P><P>When a young woman appears at the door of a country inn, dressed only in her pajamas, her fianc&eacute; publicly renounces her; but when he finds her sleepwalking over to his own house, he escorts her, still sleepwalking, directly to the church, hoping that once they reside together, the woman's somnambulism will cease.</P><P>Three protagonists, each with a different emotional-mental predicament, consider seeking psychotherapists until each realizes, apart from the others, that he or she might be entering a hell from which there would be no escape.</P><P>An young woman albino living in a northern climate falls in love with a man from a sunny country; and once she follows him home, she tragically succumbs to a sunstroke, melting away much like the snow-maiden of traditional myth.</P><P>Meant to be a parable of masochism, this ballet confines several athletic performers to a single space open at the front but otherwise five feet on each side.</P><I><P>The Baseball Game</I> is a ballet divided into nine sections that the program note calls innings. The large company is divided into two groups, each with nine dancers. Each performance has such variable results that stagehands can be observed going through motions that resemble the making of wagers.</P><P>A gangster's moll sleeps with his chief bodyguard when both think their boss is away; but when their infidelity is discovered, the bodyguard is killed and the moll poisons herself.</P><P>A young photographer, recently identified to be the victim of a sexual disease, asks successively all her recent lovers for permission to them naked, insidiously hoping to discover visible evidence of which man infected her.</P><I><P>Surplus</I> is an anthology of disconnected sequences that a choreographer could not use in his previous ballets.</P><P>A woman tells of her sister and alter ego, a dancer who tours seven American cities to earn sufficient money to build a house for her family back home; in each city she encounters a different tempting sin.</P><P>On a green lawn, twenty-eight dancers, dressed in slightly different shades of green, blend into the natural surroundings as they move about.</P><P>This dance suggests, wholly through movements, events culminating in the assassination of our president.</P><P>While a young man, lying on a warm beach, picks up a conch shell to discover its sound, a sea nymph, watching him from her hiding place, emerges to meet him, and the dance they do together resembles coition in water.</P><P>When a provincial ballet impresario visits a dancing school, hoping to find his next prima ballerina, the cynical teacher tries to interest him in the least talented girl, who, to everyone's surprise, blossoms into an international star, in part because of the impresario's attention.</P><P>The development of the leading dancers is portrayed through showing first beginning children at the <I>barre</I>, then adolescents in class, and finally soloists exhibiting their bravura techniques, against a continuous background of their eating a proper dancer's diet.</P><P>When a demonic artist seduces an aristocratic woman and then asks to live with her, the woman sees no solution to her sexual-social dilemma other than poisoning him.</P><P>A young man, unhappily engaged to marry a woman chosen for him, succumbs instead to a lady dealer and her exotic drugs.</P><P>The solo dancer portrays, through a series of highly emotional movements, the desires and thus frustrations of women left at home while their men are away at war.</P><P>This ballet portrays a mysterious fertility rite in which first an old dog and then a disfigured young woman are sacrificed.</P><P>A European sailor returns to his native fishing village with an African woman whom his neighbors at first find exotic but later reject as alien to their narrow minds.</P><P>The protracted conflict between two feuding families is resolved when a grandmother in one falls in love with a grandfather in another and, realizing what problems their relationships make, the septuagenarians commit suicide together, prompting a necessary reconciliation over the tombs of the star-</P><P>crossed lovers--an happy political end to personal tragedies.</P><P>Summoning back to life several nuns who had violated their vows, our wicked protagonist gets them to dance with her, first clothed and then nude.</P><P>The cowboys working on a ranch flirt with every woman within sight until their boss dies, to be succeeded by a daughter whom, as their employer, they are obliged to respect.</P><P>A prince whose love for a princess is unrequited carves a statue of himself to win her admiration.

She is allowed to resume her human form for only a few hours at a time. On one such occasion she meets a rival gang leader who falls in love with her and vows to rescue her. At a gang convocation, a former gang leader appears with his daughter disguised as a black swan who looks exactly like the other woman&#151;turned&#151;swan. She bewitches the rival leader who conquers her until another black swan, actually his fianc&eacute;e, appears. The second gang leader realizes that he is violated his vow; and sooner than face retribution from his peers, who place a great value upon oaths, he rushes to the city park in which his fianc&eacute; and her swan companions are mourning rejection.
