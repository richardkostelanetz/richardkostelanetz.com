Founded in 1880, it is the principal surviving representation   of the great age of Berlin Jewry and, by extension, of the time when Berlin   was one of the world's great cities with the largest Jewish population of any   city between Warsaw and New York (other than Vienna), when Berlin's Jews, though   never more than five percent of the total population, had a disproportionate   influence. Looking at the gravestones of the pre-Hitler period, one can imaginatively   reconstruct from visual, verbal and numerical detail not only individual lives   but images of a community wealthy and confident, constructing stylish mausoleums   that they expected would be visited and honored by their children and grandchildren.   By contrast, the stones of husbands and wives who committed suicide on the same   day in 1942 tell of the end of this dream. In other words, the Cemetery is a   window on Berlin history. During an extended residency in Berlin (West) as a   guest of the DAAD Kunstlerprogramm, I took a large number of color slides that   were initially intended to accompany concert performances of an audiotape <i>Kaddish</i>   (1990). However, once the slides were developed, it became vividly clear that   they could become a museum exhibition wholly on their own. Since my interpretation   of the significance of this Cemetery depends upon the abundant accumulation   of evocative details, my own vision of this exhibition of visual history has   at least two, perhaps three or four, simultaneous carousel slide projectors,   each with 240 slides, which are automatically changed every fifteen seconds.   Thus, with the projection-switching staggered, the complete cycle of 480 (or   720 or 960) slides would take one hour. The images could appear on screens along   a single wall, or on three walls of a single space. What completes the installation   is a continuous sound track, likewise 60 minutes long (and drawing upon recordings   made for the soundtrack of my film about the Cemetery), of ex-Berliners, ranging   in age from 50 to 90, talking, in either English, German, French, Spanish, Swedish,   and/or Hebrew, about the Cemetery and the Berlin represented there. Other exhibition   formats are no doubt possible. From the slides, which have negatives, we could   make color prints not only for display but for a memorable catalog. Interested   sponsors are invited to contact me soon at the address at the top of this page.   </font> </p></body></html>
