Thus, the book would open with four classic texts:Archibald MacLeish¹s Fall of the CityLucille Fletcher¹s Sorry Wrong NumberNorman Corwin¹s DaybreakKenneth Patchen¹s The City Wears a Slouch HatFollowed by contemporary texts such as these (many by writers otherwise known as poets or composers):Carol Adjorian, Portions Mechanically ReproducedCharles Amirkhanian, Seatbelt, SeatbeltBeth Anderson, Riot RotSandra Braman, VellumJohn Cage, a text to be chosenJohn Chu, Out of my MindAlbert Cook, RecallStephen Dixon, HughBob Elliott & Ray Goulding, Spelling Bee (from Write If You Get Work)Welch Everman, Trio and DuetJoe Frank, text to be chosenDick Higgins, City of AngelesJackson Mac Low, Dialog unter Dichtern/Dialog Among PoetsMichael Palmer, Idem-VRichard Kostelanetz, Minimal Audio PlaysHenry H. Roth, HotlineFrancis Schwartz, La Locura (?) de Robert SchumannAs is customary in anthologies of mine, I¹m wedded more to theconcept than to any inclusions (which will be dropped ifunavailable or too expensive), and I expect that, once permissionforms go out, other appropriate inclusions will come to my attention.</font></pre></body></html>
