The first   third, devoted to his life, would be mostly familiar, differing from previous   accounts in a more detailed explanation of what Ives did in the insurance business   (mostly supervising salesmen, rather than approaching customers himself) and   his unusual financial arrangements with younger composers who copyrighted his   pieces in exchange for preparing definitive scores (and in the case of Lou Harrison   receive Ives royalties to this day).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> The second part would   develop in detail the following paragraph, which I initially drafted in 1967   and revised for On Innovative Music(ian)s (1989):</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> <i>[Charles] Ives was   a thoroughly trained musician; but more than that, he was a great inventor--the   equal, in his own field, of Thomas Alva Edison or Samuel F. B. Morse--with several   major musical patents to his name. Ives was the first modern composer who consistently   did not resolve his dissonances. Instead of returning a piece to its tonic home   base, he would end it, metaphorically, out in the field or, sometimes, as in   the decisive dissonance concluding the Second Symphony, well into the grandstand.   While still in his teens, Ives developed his own system of polytonality--the   technique of writing for two or more different keys simultaneously--and in a   piece composed at the age of 20 (Song for Harvest Season) he assigned four different   keys to four instruments. In the Concord Sonata (composed 1909-15), Ives invented   the tone cluster--where the pianist uses either his forearm or a block of wood   to sound simultaneously whole groups, if not octaves, of notes. Another Ives   innovation was the esthetics of pop art; for Ives, like Claes Oldenburg and   Robert Rauschenberg after him, drew quotations from mundane culture--hymn tunes,   patriotic ditties, etc.--and stitched them fluently into his artistic fabric.   Other composers had incorporated "found" sounds prior to Ives, but he was probably   the first to allow a quotation to stand out dissonantly from the text--all but   waiving a flag to draw attention to itself--as well as the first, like the pop   artists after him, to distort a popular quotation into a comic semblance of   the original. Other Ivesian musical innovations include polyrhythms--where various   sections of the orchestra play in wholly different meters, often under the batons   of separate conductors, all to create multiple crossing beats of great intricacy.   As one of the first modern composers to develop distinctly eccentric musical   notations, Ives anticipated contemporary practices of graphs, charts, and abstract   patterns--manuscripts that resemble everything but traditional musical scores.   He also wrote musical notes that he knew could not be played (an esthetic equivalent   of conceptual visual art), such as a 1/1024 note in the Concord, followed by   the advice, "Play as fast as you can.</i>"</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> By focusing upon esthetic   invention, this chapter would be familiar to some but unfamiliar to others.   While including musical examples, I would not make any explanation exclusively   dependent upon them.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> The last third of the   book would focus upon the unusual quality of Ives¹s artistic imagination, which   I take to different from that of European composers of his time (and later),   but which I think resembles that of other great American artists who did their   major work before World War I, such as Gertrude Stein (who was also born in   1874), Herman Melville, Loie Fuller, Albert Pinkham Ryder, and Walt Whitman,   among others. These last thoughts draw upon my outline for a doctoral thesis   in American intellectual history (which I never did, unable to pass the prerequisite   orals). Thinking about this theme of the American imagination for some three   decades by now, I have drawn upon this cache often, most recently for the introduction   to AnOther E. E. Cummings (Norton, 1998). It would be nice to present a definitive   version here. I'm not aware of anyone before me approaching Ives in this way.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> As an appendix, I would   like to do elaborately detailed critique of the books and essays about Ives   and a longer essay about Ives recordings, especially of the major pieces (some   recordings being much better than others, even though they are not currently   in print). Thinking critically about Ivesian performance for as long as I¹ve   owned his records (more than three decades), I have thus, for instance, accumulated   over a dozen different renditions of the Concord Sonata. (See earlier examples   of this sort of disco-bibliographic commentary in the back of my Master Minds   [Macmillan, 1969].) This part too would be, as far as I can tell, unprecedented.   In another appendix belongs a complete list of Ives's compositions. A new book   on Ives must first of all be useful.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> Asked to contribute to   the Schirmer-Orion series, I was given Paul Griffiths¹ Stravinsky as a model.   His book is structured as a biography with asides to discuss individual pieces   as they were composed during Stravinsky's life. That form won't work for Ives.   Whereas Stravinsky was very much writing for market (which is one theme of Griffiths¹   book), fulfilling commissions that would soon afterwards be performed, Ives   was writing for himself. Exactly when certain works were written is an issue   currently under debate; solving those questions is not something for this book.   That's why I've proposed a structure that necessarily regards Ives's life chronologically   but views the work as a whole, rather than a sequence.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> I've not done a monograph   before and have resisted invitations (most recently for E. E. Cummings), because   I thought my predisposition to concise exposition would disintegrate in the   course of writing at great length about a single figure. On the other hand,   I've been thinking and writing about Ives for so long that I should have enough   to say without resorting to padding. As everyone knows, I don't propose to do   anything without seeing how to finish it; I don't agree to do anything professionally   that anyone else can do better. Those are two reasons why I finish so much and   always fulfill contracts. I expect to draw upon previous biographical literature,   including the Cowells' great early monograph; the thicker books by David Wooldridge   and Frank Rossiter, which both appeared two decades ago; the recent Maynard   Solomon expose of Ives's falsifying his history; and the psychoanalist Stuart   Feder's brilliant study that persuasively connects certain Ives compositions   to specific psychological experience. Fortunately, Joseph Darby, my associate   on another current project, did his M.A. thesis on Ives and so is familiar with   recent Ives scholarly literature.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> Having thought seriously   about Ives for so long, I view this as an opportunity to get my ideas out in   definitive form. My book would differ from the others in its biographical and   critical conciseness and its connecting his imagination to those of comparably   first-rank Americans working in other arts. Written in my most luminous style,   this book should hopefully supercede the Cowells's classic as the standard introduction.   Were it contracted before the end of 1994, it could become my principal winter   project that would be delivered by the following summer.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> FIRST DRAFT TOWARD MY   COMMENTARY ON IVES'S Unanswered Question (c. 1908) (Expect these preliminary   thoughts to be integrated into a fuller commentary.)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> The critic and composer   Eric Salzman, for one, has written of Ives's innovative use of music ensembles   smaller than a full orchestra and yet more populous than a string quartet. With   personnel numbering between five instruments and twenty-five, these instrumental   groupings resembled the theatre orchestras accompanying vaudeville performance   and later silent films. It was not uncommon for such orchestras often to eschew   instruments previously thought essential to any ensemble, such as a piano. Having   already given himself permission to explore alternative instrumentation, Ives   around 1908 wrote The Unanswered Question, a short piece for a quartet of flutes   (though an oboe and clarinet could be substituted for the third and fourth flutes),   a solo trumpet, and a muted string quartet. A second, more radical departure   came from placing the strings offstage. In the latter respect, this became a   model for subsequent alternative spatial placement in works by Henry Brandt,   Karlheinz Stockhausen, et al.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> Originally subtitled "A   Cosmic Landscape," The Unanswered Question is an essentially theatrical work,   dramatizing universal spiritual quest. The quiet and lanquid strings represent   humanity or the flow of life. They play (really hum) for a full thirty seconds   before another instrument is heard. The trumpet becomes the individual who asks   ultimate questions. The winds answer the questions so blithely and thus inconclusively   that the trumpet feels compelled to repeat its implorings, in only slightly   different forms. Within less than six minutes, the futility of this search for   meaning is portrayed. Perhaps the most brilliant dramatic touch was Ives's allowing   the work to end with the trumpet repeating its question(s), rather than concluding   with the strings, whose continuing presence in thus assumed in the subsequent   silence.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> Thematically the work   echoes that of Richard Wagner (d. 1881), whose life extends into Ives's (b.   1974); but whereas Wagner took hours to articulate such cosmic concerns, Ives   accomplishes the strategy in only a few minutes. In that sense, The Unanswered   Question becomes a precursor to other concise spiritual pieces in contemporary   music, such as Anton Webern's miniature masterpieces and John Cage's 4' 33"   (which likewise exploits the implications of quietude).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> Because Ives's strings   are located offstage, out of sight of their conductor, the details of their   relationship to the protagonist are left to chance; on second thought, exactly   when they enter and leave the piece doesn't really matter. In this paradox of   allowing chance whose effect is finally inconsequential, the work presages that   of John Cage.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> For all the mysteriousness   of the piece, its meanings are no less clear to us now than they were to Ives   himself, who wrote:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><i>The strings play ppp   throughout, with no change in tempo. They are to represent "The Silences of   the Druids" who speak, see, and hear nothing. The trumpet intones "The Perennial   Question of Existence" and states it in the same tone of voice each time. But   the hunt for the "Invisible Answer" undertaken by the flutes and other human   beings becomes gradually more active, faster and louder through an animando   to a con fuoco. The "Fighting Answerers," as time goes on, and after a "secret   conference," seem to realize a futility, and begin to mock "The Question"--the   strife is over for the moment. After they disappear, "The Question" is asked   again for the last time, and the "Silences" are heard beyond in undisturbed   solitude.</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> That's exactly right,   not only in its dramaturgy but in its acoustic portrayals. Writing like this   gives credence to a sense of Ives as one of those composers who understood his   work better than his commentators and didn't mind saying so.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> It is hard to think of   another similarly short work in the history of music that carries so much musical   and thematic weight. </font> </p></body></html>
