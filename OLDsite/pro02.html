Its         introduction will be drawn from "Person of Letters in the Contemporary         World" (1988) that was initially published in <i>Contemporary Authors:         Autobiographies Series</i> (Gale). The book will include his journalistic         profiles of Gertrude Stein (from <i>Margins</i>, 1974) and the visual         artist George Rhoads (<i>Smithsonian</i>, 1988), as well as the musicians         Nicolas Slonimsky (<i>The World & I</i>, 1989) and Arvo Pärt (<i>Connoisseur</i>,         1990); selections of Kostelanetz's much-anthologized poems and fictions         both visual and verbal; his extended introductions to the anthologies         <i>The New American Arts</i> (Horizon, 1965), <i>Twelve from the Sixties</i>         (Dell, 1967), Possibilities of Poetry (Delta, 1970), Future's Fictions         (<i>Panache</i>, 1971), and <i>The Avant-Garde Tradition of Literature</i>         (Prometheus, 1982). Under the rubric of "Literary Criticism," the book         should include his essays on "The American Absurd Novel," "Dada and the         Future of Fiction," "A Magazine of Worse" (<i>Poetry</i>) and his exposes         of uniformity in contemporary fiction; under "Arts Criticism," his essays         on Moholy-Nagy, The Theatre of Mixed Means, Artists' Books, and the marketing         of art vs. literature; under "Cultural History," his classic challenge         of the canon, "Locating American Literary 'Establishments,'" from <i>The         End of Intelligent Writing</i> (1974); under "Scripts," the theatrical         versions of his single-sentence "Lovings" (1991). The book will close         with examples first of his literary essays, including his 1965 memoir         of "The British Literary Scene" and his 1989 consideration of AIDS; and         then of his art with words, numbers, and lines, in audio, video, film,         and holography. The book's theme, implicit in its title, is the many-sided         edge, the forefront, regarded in terms both of subjects and career. Need         it be said that<b> All Along the Edge</b> will be, initially in its scope,         like no other retrospective in the history of American literature.
