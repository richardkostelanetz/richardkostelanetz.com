Rather than deal with their individual achievements (and individual biographies), I wouldfocus upon their times together; so that nearly all pageswould contain both their names. As I now envision it, thebook would begin with an introduction recalling their firstmeeting in Seattle in 1938. The remainder would bedevoted to such episodes in their collaboration as thefollowing:1) Their first New York recital together in 19442) The Seasons3) The early tours of the Merce Cunningham Company14) 16 Dances for a Soloist and a Company of Three (1951), which was not only their first evening-length  work but Cunningham¹s first to employ chance  operations5) Black Mountain College, including Theater Piece (1952)6) The first New York season at the end of 19527) Antic Meet, which Cunningham identifies among the first where "we could not count on the sounds as cues"; it has frequently been revived8) The 1964 world tour9) Variations V (1965)10) Un Jour ou Deux, where they were jointly commissioned by Parisian sponsors11) "Event for Television" and the development of their video dance/art12) Joint teaching, as exemplified by their participation in the International Dance Course for Professional Choreographers and Composers in England (1981)13) Roaratorio (1985)The conclusion begins with Cage¹s resigning as musicdirector and ends with Cunningham discovering Cage¹sterminally ailing body.I would expect to draw upon my 1984 appreciation of theCunningham-Cage esthetic [reprinted in<i> On InnovativeMusic(ian)s</i>], documentation already published, andinterviews with participants. The book would be 100,000words long. Rather than footnotes, it would have abibliographical afterword identifying sources. I hope thebook would be appreciated as not only a definitivecontribution to the growing Cage and Cunninghamliterature but as a model of the double biography. Thishould take no more than five years to do--maybe less, ifsufficiently supported. It is also a book that only I couldwrite.</font></pre></body></html>
