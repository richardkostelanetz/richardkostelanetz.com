Widely reviewed at   the time, it accumulated an impressive collection of encomia, which I¹ve gathered   onto four single-spaced sheets. One measure of continued interest in the book   is that from time to time I sell a copy for a hundred dollars; long ago, I retrieved   the rights. Instead of going the conventional reprint route of offsetting the   original edition and then adding a new preface, may I propose the more contemporary   possibility of reworking the original text on computer disc, deleting remarks   that are no longer relevant nor valid, adding new material in a different typeface,   reducing its length, and then retitling the book under its previous subtitle,   "The Literary Politics in America." The result would thus represent a genuine   Second Edition to both libraries (which already have many books of mine) and   those treasuring the original edition. With sufficient publicity, reviewers   might be persuaded to recognize the unprecedented opportunity offered by this   new contemporary way of reprinting.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3"> It is commonly said that   <b>The End of Intelligent Writing</b> makes genuine contributions to the understanding   of the sociology of literary reputation in America, the role of social factors   in promoting literary fame, the crisis in book publishing, the power of certain   reviewing media, and directions in the literary avant-garde. Though I continue   to comment on these issues, this book has the definitive texts upon which my   subsequent comments are based. To some printers today, typesetting from disc   is cheaper than offsetting pages; and since this new text would be shorter than   its predecessor, the publisher would save money in printing as well. (The only   person needing to work more would be the author.) Publishers wanting to consider   the original text, ideally with this proposal in mind, are invited to contact   the author at the top of this page. </font></p></body></html>
