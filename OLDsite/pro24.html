A choice subject   would be the great American comedians, whose work I¹ve admired all my life,   whose lives and best jokes are embedded in my memory. What I propose would be   biographical entries alphabetically organized, with individual characterizations   of each person¹s comedy in the course of noting classic gags and currently available   works. Need I mention that the number of recent comedy retrospectives on American   television is one index of a continuing interest in and enthusiasm for native   comedians.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> This dictionary would   differ from earlier books on American comedy in casting the widest possible   net, including not only stand-ups (e.g., Richard Pryor and George Carlin, among   many others), but comic film characters (Bugs Bunny, the Marx Brothers), radio   comedians (Jack Benny, Stan Freberg), comic authors (Mark Twain, Joseph Heller),   comic composers (Spike Jones, Peter Schickele), and parttime comedians (e.g.,   Yogi Berra, Frank Layton, John Cage). One theme is the richness and variety   of American humor. No similar book exists, to my knowledge.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> I hope that every individual   entry, which may run as long as two thousand words, will both inform and amuse.   (If not, it should be discarded). My goal is the creation of a standard reference   that can be read from start to finish, as well as consulted at random, with   the expectation of both edification and amusement.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"> I know from experience   that I can deliver to whatever length the publisner thinks most appropriate.   It would take about a year to finish. Should a prospective publisher like to   consider sampIes from my earlier Dictionary, please let me know. Thank you for   your attention. </font> </p></body></html>
