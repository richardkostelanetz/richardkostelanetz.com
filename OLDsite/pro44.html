Most of the selections discuss music, some don¹t, while a few could be classified as poems. I¹ve avoided "interviews" and texts acknowledging collaborators. I¹m prepared to argue in an introduction that composers write better than visual artists, at least in America. Some samples:Milton Babbitt, "The Composer as Specialist" (aka "Who Cares If You Listen"), in RK¹s Esthetics Contemporary (1978)- -"On Having Been and Still Being an American Composer," Persepctives of New Music (1989)Belá Bártok, "Some Lingustic Observations (1946), reprinted in Essays (Faber, 1976)Marion Bauer, selections to be determinedJack Beeson, "Grand Not So Grand," Opera News (1963)Leonard Bernstein, original text of his review of Gertrude Stein¹s Last Operas and Plays, reprinted in RK¹s Gertrude Stein Advanced (1990)William Billings, "To All Musical Practitioners" (1770)- -Excerpts from A Continental Harmony (1794)Marc Blitzstein, "Popular Music--An Invasion, 1923-1933," Modern MusicErnst Bloch, "What ŒWhat¹ of Expression in General "Anthony Braxton, selections from his voluminous writingsJohn Cage, "Ladies of the Monday Club and Gentlemen of the Faculty," in RK¹s John Cage (1970)- -One section of I-VI (1989)Elliott Carter, selections to be determined  (stbd)Ornette Coleman Œs notes to Skies of AmericaAaron Copland, "From a Composer¹s Journal," Copland on Music (1961)- -"Composer from Brooklyn" (1939)Henry Cowell, "Charles E.

Final selection depends upon the number of pages (or amount of words) desired by the publisher and the available budget for permissions. My job as the book¹s editor is to provide the best available text within the constraints. An introduction would explain why American composers have aspired for excellence in writing. I would provide headnotes, if desired. Need I add that I have edited several books of writings by American composers.</font></pre></body></html>
