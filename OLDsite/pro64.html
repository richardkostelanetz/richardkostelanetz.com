That was only the first step. What we want to do next is produce an eight-track   tape for eight loudspeakers theatrically arrayed (and for more modest venues,   a four-speaker version as well)--an electronic opera for repeated concert performances   and/or continuous installations that ideally also include a videotape, either   for standard monitors or a large projection screen, containing imaginative presentations   of an English translation of the text and related nonrepresentational imagery.   In all cases, the speakers will made to sound, as they do on the sample tape,   as though they are participating in a live performance. I prefer producing audiotape,   whether for radio broadcast or disc or a continuous performance, to live theater   for several persuasive reasons: (1) it would be unfeasible (and extravagantly   expensive) to gather religious professionals into a single presentation space;   (2) it would, on the other hand, be inappropriate to have such prayers spoken   by "actors"; (3) on multitrack audiotape can be realized a complex verbal-musical-theatrical   experience of a permanent quality that would be impossible in live performance   (product being more important to me than process); (4) sacred texts, to my senses,   especially benefit from metahuman acoustic enhancements; (5) the completed performance   can be distributed, less expensively, in its definitive form forever, initially   as a stereo audiotape to Westdeutscher Rundfunk, which commissioned it, and   to publishers of standard records and discs but also (in stereo, four-track   or eight-track forms) to public venues such as museums, theaters and synagogues   for regularly repeated, if not continuous, performances; (6) the result, unlike   a live performance, offers equal access to all listeners. Ever since producing   books about alternative performance theater (1968) and Moholy-Nagy (1970), I've   been interested in finding an operatic analogue for an entirely "mechanical   theater" that would proceed apart from human intervention; the development of   multitrack audiotape makes this strategically feasible. <b>Kaddish</b> represents   my first major attempt to realize a work in this vein. A repeatable performance   medium would be more appropriate for a work such as this, a work whose content   is extremely subtle and whose narrative action is conceptually unusual in form:   The linguistic representation of the Diaspora is portrayed not through changes   in the text but through the appearance of different voices revealing various   backgrounds. Most of my field recording was done in New York City (my home town),   where rabbis and cantors from around the world permanently reside, and throughout   Europe, where I am invited to work every year; and need I say that the Hebrew   prayer for the dead is safely in the public domain. The stereo audiotape was   realized at the brand-new Opus digital editing console at Lexicon, Inc., in   Waltham, MA; final composition of four- track and eight-track tapes will take   place at EMS-Stockholm, where I have worked gratis at a twenty-four track console   several times before, or at a comparable private American studio. For both concert   performances and continuous installations, I expect to produce an accompanying   videotape which will resemble the sample <i>Onomatopoeia</i> (1990) in having   a visible text composed to illustrate the verbal content of the audiotape; the   typography and visual recitation will be my own. Aside from assistance in recording   rabbis and editing videotape, I have been and will be personally involved in   every step of the financing, creation and distribution of this work. The multitrack<b>   Kaddish</b> will be offered to exhibitors that have previously presented films   and tapes of mine, including the Jewish Museum and the Whitney Museum, for multispeaker   + video presentations in either concerts or continuous installations; WDR will   also probably use it in its own performance festivals comparable to the one   recently at the Whitney at Equitable in New York City. It might also be possible   to use this <b>Kaddish</b> as the sound for a live theatrical performance that,   say, could include mime or dance, much as the choreographer Manuel Alum used   my Invocations (1981) for performances both in Rio Piedras, PR (1985) and New   York, NY (1986). May I add that it seems odd to me that we have not had more   musical-theater for audiotape in our time, as we are more accustomed to the   strictly aural experience of musical theater than we commonly allow, initially   on radio and then on records; so that we could estimate that by now more operatic   theater is just heard, rather than seen and heard. Moreover, in Europe as well   as America, operas have been written especially for radio theater (by Walter   Goehr in 1930, Gian Carlo Menotti in 1939, Italo Montemezzi in 1943, among others);   but prior to the age of audiotape, their original performances were necessarily   produced within the constraints of live time. However, in the post-WWII period   came audiotape, which can be spliced more cleanly than the preceding technology   of wire; and multitrack tape, which allows the composer to separate the component   sounds and readjust them individually for a definitive stereo-spatial performance;   and then sound-processing capabilities, such as filtering or more sophisticated   computer speech-synthesis. More recently came videotape, with its own capabilities,   including the possible use of mixed-down multitrack audiotape for its stereo   soundtrack. In this context, it is clear that the most immediate predecessors   for what I plan to do are the electro-acoustic soundtracks of two videotapes:   Charles Dodge's <i>The Story of Our Lives</i> (1974), subtitled "An Operatic   Dialogue for Male and Female Synthetic Voices," and Robert Ashley's <i>Perfect   Lives</i> (1984). Indicatively, both these soundracks are also currently available   just on audio-storage media (aka cassetes). My own <b>Kaddish</b> for audiotape   will thus be not for an elite but for a larger audience, which is to say most   of us millions who are, individually as well as collectively, accustomed just   to hearing musical-theater. May it also stand perhaps as a pioneering example   for future musical-theater initially on audiotape. My deepest ambitions for   this proposal, need they be known, are to create a truly contemporary successor   to the grand tradition of sacred musical- theater and, second, to realize only   the second classic electro-acoustic audiotape of an Hebraic text [the first   being, alas, Karlheinz Stockhausen's <i>Gesang der Junglinge</i> (1955)]. </font> </p></body></html>
