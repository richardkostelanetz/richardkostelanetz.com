The best way to illustrate   this would be an anthology whose selection confirms the reinterpretations--a   book comparable to Kostelanetz¹s The Yale Gertrude Stein (Yale University, 1980)   and AnOther Cummings (Norton,1995). The Nash we have in mind would open with   his best couplets, such as "The Fly," "The Eel," and "The flules," and continue   with triplets and quatrains. The book would then include poems with fairly conventional   poetic lines and rhymes, such as "Pappy Wants a Poppy," "The Private Dining   Room," and "So That¹s Who I Remind Me Of," along with those with more audacious   extended lines and strikingly forced rhymes, such as "My Trip Doaboa" and "How   Do You Say Ha-Ha in French?" I want to reprint skinny poems, such as "The Screen   with the Face with the Voice," and essentially prose poems, such as "I Want   a Drink of Water, but not from the Thermos" and "Will You Have Your Tedium Rare   or Medium?" realized. Among the other Nash poems interesting me are "Calling   SPring VIIMMMC," "I Do, I Will, I Have," "A Brief Guide to Rhyrning," "What,   No Sheep?" I Remember Yule," "Correction: Eye Delved and Adam Span," "The Strange   Case of the Cautious Motorist," "It Must Be the Milk," "Kindly Unhitch That   Star, Buddy," "Caesar Knifed Again," and "Curt Up and Diet." I expect to include   a generous selection of Nash¹s skeletal stories, beginning with "The Strange   Case of Mr. Donnybrook¹s Boredom" and "The Strange Case of the Ambitious Caddy."   Publishers wishing to consider the preliminary selection, with the preliminary   introduction, are invited to contact the author at the address at the top of   this page. Thank you. </font> </p></body></html>
