</blockquote>
<p>As the large North American publishers are less and less able to
issue the manuscripts essential to the survival of intelligent
writing, the need for new and independent book-making enterprise
becomes greater and more urgent; yet the natural cycle of decay and
rebirth has not progressed with enough deliberate speed. Though
many new firms were founded in the past decade, not all of them
were particularly interested in young writers or radically
different books; and none, in the end, served emerging writers as
nobly as, say, Bennett Cerf (1898-1971) and Alfred A. Knopf (b.
1891) supported some of their respective contemporaries. Not only
did alarmingly few of the new houses risk that kind of eclectic
literary publishing, but few of the affluent or entrepreneurial
young founded new publishing firms; and given the growing expenses
and hazards of the business, those that were successfully launched
subsequently encountered considerable difficulty staying alive.
Truly alternative publishers must be distinguished from both
sectarian houses and the carbon copies of commercial publishing (as
well as those specializing in pornography). Sectarian publishers
were founded to print books by, for, and about a certain faith,
ethnic culture, esoteric enthusiasm, or political persuasion, such
as Catholicism, Armenians, astrology, and Communism, respectively;
and none of these publishers are, by definition, at all interested
in anything outside their initially circumscribed orbit. Other new
imprints grew out of successful periodicals, such as
<em>Playboy</em> and <em>Psychology Today,</em> largely to provide
books of material similar to that featured in the magazine (and
probably destined for precisely the same audience).</p>
<p>Other new imprints were started by experienced commercial
publishers, some of whom had resigned from (or had been fired by)
the larger corporations to which they had previously sold their
stock. Victor Weybright, for instance, built up the New American
Library before selling it to the Times-Mirror, Inc.; and their
mismanagement of the paperback firm, as he tells it, led to his
resignation (and the subsequent decline of NAL). In1966, he joined
his son-in-law, Truman Talley, in founding Weybright &amp; Talley,
which floundered aimlessly before they sold it to David McKay, Inc.
Richard Baron sold 60 percent of the Dial Press, which he once
solely owned, to Dell before departing to found an imprint under
his own name in 1968. Seymour Lawrence, a new publisher (est. 1965)
affiliated with Dell, was a long-time senior editor at Little,
Brown; the proprietors of Gambit (est. 1968) in Boston had long
labored for Houghton Mifflin; Richard Kluger, the founder of
Charterhouse (est. 1971), had previously been a top editor at Simon
&amp; Schuster and then at Atheneum; and Peter Weyden had been
executive editor at <em>Ladies Home Journal</em> before founding a
press under his own name. All of these new firms were replicas of
the larger outfits with offices in midtown Manhattan or mainline
Boston; the books they published plainly revealed their
founders&acirc;&euro;&trade; devotion to the myths and aspirations
of the literary-industrial complex.</p>
<p>The mark of truly alternative publishing, by contrast, is books
that long-established houses would not do; and all of the new
publishers discussed in the following pages exhibit, at least in
part, the kinds of commitment conducive to the future of
intelligent writing. They tend to favor not only classes of
writers, but kinds of writing ignored by the literary-industrial
behemoths. One or another of these new presses has been
particularly open to black writers, women writers, post-Black
Mountain poets, Canadian writers, young writers, and experimental
writers. Had the manuscripts published by these alternative presses
actually been submitted to the commercial houses, they would surely
have been declined as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;too
incoherent,&acirc;&euro; &acirc;&euro;&oelig;too
religious,&acirc;&euro; &acirc;&euro;&oelig;too
esoteric,&acirc;&euro; &acirc;&euro;&oelig;too
provincial,&acirc;&euro; &acirc;&euro;&oelig;too
peculiar-looking,&acirc;&euro; &acirc;&euro;&oelig;too
personal,&acirc;&euro; &acirc;&euro;&oelig;too
idiosyncratic.&acirc;&euro; Given conditions elsewhere, it is not
surprising that most of the decade&acirc;&euro;&trade;s most
consequential books of poetry came from small presses.</p>
<p>Most alternative presses have been founded by writers who
realized the larger meaning of their own predicament; and these
alternative writer-publishers draw upon income gained from outside
sources&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;usually a teaching job, though few would
regard either themselves or their work as
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;academic.&acirc;&euro; Most remain one-man
operations where the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;publisher&acirc;&euro;
functions as editor, designer, secretary, and delivery boy, if not
the printer as well. As loans for this kind of venture are not easy
to come by, most alternative publishers are self-financed, their
founders scarcely compensating themselves for their working time.
Only a scant few, unlike little magazines, are currently subsidized
by universities or other cultural institutions. If only for the
quality of their intentions, nearly all alternative pressmen are as
personally laudable as other literary servants; the best of them
print serious writing that would otherwise be lost.</p>
<p>Lower operating costs also enable them to do first editions in
smaller numbers than commercial firms would find
feasible&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;less than 5000
copies&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and to keep the book
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;in print&acirc;&euro; until all of the
available copies are sold. Some publish strictly limited editions,
customarily done by the publisher himself on a handpress and signed
by the author (along with any collaborating artists), all of which
hopefully give the book the aura of a treasured
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;art&acirc;&euro;
possession&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an aura comparable to that of a
graphics portfolio. Others use the cheapest available offset
processes to print more copies than they can possibly sell. Some
alternative-press books have spines with the title and the
author&acirc;&euro;&trade;s name, while others are simply stapled
down the middle and folded over. Most issue only paperback
editions, in sharp contrast to the commercial replicas, not only
because the small press&acirc;&euro;&trade;s likely customers
rarely buy hardbacks, but also because
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;subsidiary rights&acirc;&euro; are not a
primary part of their business.</p>
<p>Books issued by alternative publishers are not necessarily
better or worse than those of commercial houses; in practice, each
is editorially selective in different ways. However, just as
certain kinds of badness are more typical of one kind of
publishing, so certain kinds of excellence are available in the
best small-press books, such as realized formal invention which
scarcely turns up in literary-industrial produce. One by-product of
alternative publishing is the possibility of alternative
reading.</p>
<p>The biggest problem that these publishers have in common, after
the acquisition of operating capital (politely called
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;seed money&acirc;&euro;), is distribution. Most
place their books in those nearby bookstores already sympathetic to
literary ventures. Some use national distributors to reach outlets
beyond their immediate milieu, while others mail copies to selected
retailers across the country. Some new presses have tried to
develop a list of regular subscribers who, much like magazine
subscribers, pay in advance for whatever is published. As most
small presses fail to turn an immediate profit, and their
proprietors find that their venture consumes increasing amounts of
time and money, only a few survive more than a decade. However, if
they pick good writers who are subsequently acclaimed, the unsold
copies will fetch surprisingly high prices on the rare-book market.
Kenneth Rexroth quotes a book dealer who noted,
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Any book of poetry which
isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t complete vanity publication trash will
double in price three years after it goes off the
market.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>Some small presses bring out as many as twenty new books a year
while others print only one book, such as X-Communications for Liam
O&acirc;&euro;&trade;Gallagher&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>The Blue
Planet Notebooks</em> (1972), or only one author, such as the
Turtle Island Foundation for the works in various genres by the
late Jaime de Angulo, or Emil Antonucci&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
Journeyman Press for the otherwise neglected minimalist poetry of
Robert Lax. Writers whose books are ignored completely by the big
houses can gain a certain celebrity entirely from small press
publications&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for example, the poet Doug Blazek,
who placed the first 17 of his books with a dozen different
publishers, and the man-of-letters Hugh Fox, whose 18 books were
done under nine imprints. Some of the new book publishers grew out
of literary magazines, the editor deciding that a single writer
could fill an entire issue. <em>Quixote, The Sixties, The Smith,
Tri-Quarterly, Intrepid, Elizabeth, Abraxas, Assembling,
Lillabulero, Genesis:Grasp, Mulch, Caterpillar, Radical America,
Ann Arbor Review, Cotyledon, White Pelican,</em> among other
periodicals, have also published books. Approximately one-fourth of
the Committee of Small Magazine Editors and Publishers, according
to a 1972 survey, published both books and magazines. George
Chambers&acirc;&euro;&trade; <em>The Bonnyclabber</em> (1972), a
first-rate experimental fiction, was issued by two little
magazines, <em>Panache</em> and <em>December,</em> collaborating
for a single shot. (Each had previously published another book
wholly on its own.) One new imprint, Douglas Books, evolved from a
New York record company of the same name; another, Links, grew out
of a successful pop music songbook publisher. Small presses in all
sizes are so numerous by now that the following survey, though
superficially compendious, is certainly incomplete; yet for all
kinds of obvious reasons, there are fewer new small presses than
literary magazines.</p>
<p>Several of the larger new firms were full-time ventures founded
independently of magazines by young editors who had previously
worked for the larger houses. The first and most obvious advantage
of having one&acirc;&euro;&trade;s own firm is editorial autonomy.
The same editor who previously had to convince his
firm&acirc;&euro;&trade;s president, sales manager, and others
could now make crucial editorial decisions on his own. The author
could have the comparable pleasure of dealing directly with the
chief, instead of an underling (who invariably must
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;ask someone else&acirc;&euro;). One experienced
writer I know was so surprised and pleased to hear an editor say,
immediately after examining the manuscript,
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;We&acirc;&euro;&trade;d like to do it
now,&acirc;&euro; that he never got around to asking for any
advance money.</p>

will always be newcomers ready to snatch the good manuscripts that

</blockquote>
<p>The oldest genuinely alternative publisher in New York, if not
in all North America, is James Laughlin&acirc;&euro;&trade;s New
Directions, founded nearly forty years ago and (unlike Grove Press)
still issuing many books that no one else would even
consider&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Jesse Reichek&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
totally visual fiction, <em>etcetera</em> (1965),
Jean-Fran&Atilde;&sect;ois Bory&acirc;&euro;&trade;s post-concrete
pastiche, <em>Once Again</em> (1968), and Marvin
Cohen&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>The Self-Devoted Friend</em> (1968),
among others. It has also displayed an exemplary loyalty to its
best American authors&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Kenneth Rexroth, Kenneth
Patchen, Gary Snyder, Denise Levertov, most of whom had previously
been ignored by New York publishers. However, even though its
founder scarcely qualifies as a pensioner, the firm has lost its
earlier initiative, never, in recent years, publishing books by an
American writer currently under forty. Its most prominent
successor, particularly in poetry publishing, was City Lights, the
first San Francisco literary firm ever to win a national audience.
(Precursors failing to survive include the Colt Press and Circle
Editions, both of which did several good books in the forties.)
Since there were no local publishers predisposed to literature,
even Rexroth, the putative dean of the San Francisco poets, had,
like Robinson Jeffers before him, published most of his books in
New York. Younger West Coast poets like William Everson (a.k.a.
Brother Antonius) and Robert Duncan also published their own
earliest books.</p>
<p>Founded in 1955 by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, a New York poet (b.
1919), City Lights took its name from a short-lived San Francisco
critical magazine (1953-54) edited by Peter Martin, who was also
Ferlinghetti&acirc;&euro;&trade;s partner in founding the popular
City Lights bookstore. This imprint published a pioneering series
of inexpensively produced poetry pamphlets. As the first was
Ferlinghetti&acirc;&euro;&trade;s own <em>Pictures of the Gone
World</em> (1955) and the fourth was Allen
Ginsberg&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Howl and Other Poems</em> (1956),
the imprint thrived on the
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;beats&acirc;&euro;&trade;&acirc;&euro;
notoriety and subsequent popularity. City Lights also published
other anti-academic poets who were then ignored by the eastern
houses&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Patchen, Bob Kaufman, and Gregory Corso
(all of whom later passed on to New Directions). Other new San
Francisco poetry presses such as White Rabbit and Auerhahn, no
doubt impressed by City Lights&acirc;&euro;&trade; example, emerged
from nowhere; and publicists spoke of a
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Renaissance.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>However, as the sixties brought a new literary culture, City
Lights appeared tied to an earlier position, along with its kind of
poetry, all but completely neglecting the newer writers.
Itpublished fewer new books in the seventies, and nearly all of
these were prose. Though City Lights had functioned as a
distributor for other West Coast poetry publishers, that service
was terminated by the late sixties; and until new channels of
distribution emerged, Oyez and other California imprints were
scarcely seen in eastern bookstores. The unfortunate truth is that
a small publisher&acirc;&euro;&trade;s success, rare though it is,
can have the negative effect of undermining the purposeful energy
necessary for continuing editorial adventure; so that, in its
literary politics at least, City Lights became the first
conservative establishment ever ensconced in California.
Small-mindedness, in one form or another, tends to be a recurring
fault of alternative publishing.</p>
<p>The past decade&acirc;&euro;&trade;s most prominent avant-garde
publisher has been the Something Else Press, founded in 1964 by
Dick Higgins (b. 1938), himself a sometime poet, composer, printer,
film-maker, mixed-means theatrician, and scholar with both diverse
avant-garde interests and an energized sense of historical
necessity. All these other activities notwithstanding, book
publishing has been the most substantial of his achievements. The
press&acirc;&euro;&trade;s first venture was, like City
Lights&acirc;&euro;&trade; opening book, a collection of the
proprietor&acirc;&euro;&trade;s own work,
<em>Postface/Jefferson&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Birthday</em> (1964),
his personal predicament as an experimental writer and critic
inspiring the creation of a necessary enterprise. The
firm&acirc;&euro;&trade;s founding manifesto included this
appropriate declaration:</p>
<p>When asked what one is doing, one can only explain it as
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;something else.&acirc;&euro; Now one does
something big, now one does something small, now another big thing,
now another little thing. Always it is something else.</p>
<p>The firm&acirc;&euro;&trade;s opening lists revealed,
nonetheless, more particular commitments to the international
musical-artistic avant-garde that Higgins had discovered in the
early sixties; and among the Press&acirc;&euro;&trade;s most
important publications are books by an older generation of
influential non-literary artists: Ray Johnson&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
<em>The Paper Snake</em> (1965), Claes
Oldenburg&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Store Days</em> (1967), John
Cage&acirc;&euro;&trade;s elegant anthology of <em>Notations</em>
(1968), Merce Cunningham and Frances Starr&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
<em>Changes: Notes on Choreography</em> (1969), all of which are
extremely imaginative&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;quite
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;something
else&acirc;&euro;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in conception, content, and
design.</p>
<p>These titles defined a kind of publishing previously rare in
America&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;different in experimental seriousness
from the glossy picture books of the art publishers, and different
as well from both the extravagant hand-printed poetry books and the
more Spartan productions of City Lights and New Directions. Perhaps
the closest American precursor to Something Else was Wittenborn,
Schultz, Inc., a New York art-book retailer who issued an
impressive series of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Documents of Modern
Art&acirc;&euro; in the late forties and early fifties, or Paul
Theobald, a Chicago art-book store that published
Moholy-Nagy&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Vision in Motion</em> (1947),
among other similarly post-Bauhaus titles, in the same post-World
War II decade. One auspicious successor in this tradition was
George Maciunas&acirc;&euro;&trade; Fluxus, essentially a graphics
firm that issued printed packets along with other
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;multiples&acirc;&euro;; a more recent semblance
is the Press of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design which
opened in 1973 with <em>The Architecture of Ludwig
Wittgenstein</em>. Art galleries and museums that occasionally
publish books also fall into this tradition. It was the Whitney
Museum of American Art, rather than a commercial firm, that
produced <em>Samaras Album</em> (1971), an awesome visual-verbal
essay on narcissism by the sculptor Lucas Samaras.</p>
<p>In addition to its books by artists, the Something Else Press
brought out a series of invaluable, and otherwise unavailable,
pamphlets by allied and precursor figures, many of them European.
It reprinted the most eccentric books of Gertrude Stein (for
examples, the full-length <em>The Making of Americans</em> and
<em>Geography and Plays</em>) and Henry Cowell (<em>New Musical
Resources</em>). Responsive as well to neglected older
experimentalists, Higgins published unprecedentedly large
collections of poetry by Bern Porter and Jackson Mac
Low&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;respectively <em>Found Poems</em> (1972) and
<em>Stanzas for Iris Lezak</em> (1972). The Something Else edition
of Emmett Williams&acirc;&euro;&trade; <em>An Anthology of Concrete
Poetry</em> (1967) became the firm&acirc;&euro;&trade;s best-seller
(over 15,000 copies), if not its most influential book; and
Williams&acirc;&euro;&trade; own novel, <em>Sweethearts</em>
(1967), was also far beyond the bounds of conventional publishing,
as well as the best of its author&acirc;&euro;&trade;s several
works. Something Else also published one of my own books,
<em>Breakthrough Fictioneers</em> (1973)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an
anthology that was declined as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;something
else&acirc;&euro; by the larger publisher who initially contracted
it. At least half of its nearly hundred titles are distinctive and
individually memorable. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;A good
newspaper,&acirc;&euro; in A.J. Liebling&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
aphorism, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;is as truly an educational
institution as a good college.&acirc;&euro; So is a substantial
avant-garde publisher.</p>
<p>In spite of such intentions and achievements, Something
Else&acirc;&euro;&trade;s books suffered from insufficient notice
even from those media commonly regarded as
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;crazy about the New&acirc;&euro;; and those
critics who tried to review its titles for the established media
invariably encountered resistances and rebuffs. It is indicative
that neither <em>The New York Times Book Review</em> nor <em>The
New York Review of Books</em> has ever singled out a Something Else
title for individual review. However, since the
press&acirc;&euro;&trade;s prominence in avant-garde circles was
undisputed, Higgins received and rejected many manuscripts that
could (and should) have been published as
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;something else,&acirc;&euro; but, since the gap
between Something Else and everyone else was so great, these works
would probably not appear at all. By superintending the most
propitious channel for a certain kind of book-writing, Higgins
assumed a power whose form was not unlike Jason
Epstein&acirc;&euro;&trade;s over radical criticism, though
different, of course, in quality and operation, for Higgins himself
recognized the dangers implicit in such a concentration of
editorial authority due to the absence of substantial competitors.
Partly because the New York reviewing media were so unresponsive,
Higgins moved the business first to California and then to northern
Vermont.</p>
<p>The default of New Directions and then Grove, as well as City
Lights, created large gaps in the publication of counter-academic
poetry; and one of the first to fill this vacuum was Corinth Books
in New York. Founded in the late fifties by Ted Wilentz, then a
prominent Greenwich Village bookstore proprietor in close touch
with its literate community, Corinth issued a volume of Allen
Ginsberg&acirc;&euro;&trade;s pre-Howl poetry, <em>Empty Mirror:
Early Poems</em> (1961), and Charles Olson&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
<em>Maximus Poems</em> (1960), as well as reprinting, in 1959, Bob
Brown&acirc;&euro;&trade;s pioneering collection of visual poetry,
<em>1450-1950</em> (1959), which was originally published thirty
years before. Pursuing the kinds of previously neglected work
gathered together in Donald Allen&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
counter-establishment anthology, <em>The New American Poetry</em>
(1960), Corinth published &acirc;&euro;&oelig;San
Francisco&acirc;&euro; poets, such as Gary Snyder and Philip
Whalen; &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Black Mountain&acirc;&euro; poets, such
as Olson and Robert Creeley; &acirc;&euro;&oelig;New
York&acirc;&euro; poets like Barbara Guest and Frank
O&acirc;&euro;&trade;Hara; black poets, such as LeRoi Jones,
Clarence Major, Tom Weatherly, and Jay Wright; and then, unlike
City Lights, an even younger generation of poets, mostly associated
with the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;New York
School&acirc;&euro;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Lewis Warsh, Anne Waldman,
Peter Schjedahl, and Ted Berrigan&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in addition to
Brenda Herold, a talented teenager from New Orleans. Sustaining the
press through personal adversity while he moved through a
succession of other jobs, Wilentz has kept everything in print
(unless the author wanted to incorporate his Corinth book into a
larger subsequent work), and the press slowly but surely became one
of America&acirc;&euro;&trade;s most substantial poetry publishers
whose success was based not upon capital or celebrity-chasing but
tasteful perseverance.</p>
<p>By incorporating counter-conventional work into more general
aims, a few other recently founded New York publishers have put
alternative work into print. Grossman Publishers, set up in 1962
(and now a division of the Viking Press), has mixed much
undistinguished fiction by alumni of creative writing schools with
such truly alternative titles as Madeline Gins&acirc;&euro;&trade;
<em>Word Rain</em> (1969) and M.D. Elevitch&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
<em>Grips</em> (1972), as well as importing books of American
poetry&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;mostly post-Black Mountain, varying
greatly in quality&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;originally published by Cape
Goliard in England. Grossman&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Orion Press
subsidiary under separate editorship did one of the best novels of
the late sixties, Kenneth Gangemi&acirc;&euro;&trade;s scrupulously
uninflected <em>Olt</em> (1969). Another New York firm, Outerbridge
&amp; Dienstfrey, established in 1969, issued such unusual titles
as Edmund Carpenter and Ken Heyman&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>They
Became What They Beheld</em> (1970), a profound verbal-visual essay
that many other publishers had rejected, plus G.S.
Gravenson&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>The Sweetmeat Saga</em> (1971),
a novel so typographically eccentric that its manuscript had to be
photo-offset (rather than typeset). Once Dienstfrey departed,
however, the firm&acirc;&euro;&trade;s lists lost their literary
edge.</p>
<p>Among the other smaller New York publishers doing important
alternative literature are Lita Hornick&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
Kulchur Foundation whose two books a year have included Charles
Henri Ford&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Silver Flower Coo</em> (1968)
and David Antin&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Talking</em> (1972); Ralph
Gibson&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Lustrum Press is revolutionizing the
publication of book-length photographic essays; 1st Casualty Press
in Brooklyn opened with a much-rejected anthology of war poems by
Vietnam veterans, <em>Winning Hearts &amp; Minds</em> (1972),
which, after it won acclaim, was reprinted by McGraw-Hill; Lawrence
Dent&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Winter House, whose most unusual book has
been Frederick Barthelme&acirc;&euro;&trade;s indescribable
<em>Rangoon</em> (1970), has also issued collections of young
dramatists&acirc;&euro;&trade; plays; Harold
Witt&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Croton Press did Michael
Disend&acirc;&euro;&trade;s unforgettable novel, <em>Stomping the
Goyim</em> (1969), and collected Donald Phelps&acirc;&euro;&trade;
much-admired essays into <em>Covering Ground</em> (1969); C. W.
Truesdale&acirc;&euro;&trade;s New Rivers Press specializes in
handsome editions of poets not collected before; John Bernard
Meyers&acirc;&euro;&trade; Tibor de Nagy Editions has selected the
best of the early &acirc;&euro;&oelig;New York School&acirc;&euro;;
Vito Acconci&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>0 to 9</em> did its
founder&acirc;&euro;&trade;s early books; Larry
Fagin&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Adventures in Poetry has mimeographed
lots of second-generation &acirc;&euro;&oelig;New York
School&acirc;&euro; trivia, along with inarguably innovative texts
by Clark Coolidge and Jennifer Bartlett; the Vanishing Rotating
Triangle, founded by Leandro Katz and Ted Castle, is devoted to the
confluence of Latin-American literature and avant-garde art; George
Wittenborn, the art-book dealer mentioned before, though no longer
publishing art books, has continued to issue the rigorously
difficult fictions of Arlene Zekowski and Stanley Berne; Johnny
Stanton&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Siamese Banana put out Keith
Cohen&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Madness in Literature</em> (1970);
Ray Freed&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Doctor Generosity Press was founded
in a New York bar that also presents poetry readings; Barlenmir
House does collections of otherwise unfavored poets; the Eakins
Press, Johanna Gunderson&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Red Dust, and George
Koppelman&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Seven Woods are still other
alternative publishers issuing important work. Perhaps because
writers living in New York are more immediately aware of the
failings of big publishers, they are less likely than provincials
to bang their heads forever against literary-industrial walls.</p>

<p>The other part must be the small publisher devoted to bringing
out works of quality which do not have a chance to make their ways
in commercial publishing. My feeling was that book publishing
needed the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;little publisher&acirc;&euro; the
same way that the world of magazines needed the
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;little magazine.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p align="right">&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Alan Swallow,
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;American Publishing and the American
Writer&acirc;&euro; (1960)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Distance from New York, or at least from midtown Manhattan, may
be prerequisite for truly alternative publishing so that
independent editorial taste can remain less awed by both transient
fashions and exclusively New York pressures. Editors in the
provinces might also avoid the European influences that afflict not
only a fairly serious midtown publisher like George Braziller, say,
but even the Something Else Press (during its Manhattan period).
However, unless the provincial firm is wealthy enough like Houghton
Mifflin or the University of California Press to establish a
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;New York office,&acirc;&euro; the primary peril
of publishing outside New York is even less proximity to the most
powerful media of review and publicity. This ineluctable lack of
media interest, even if expected, inevitably puts a damper on
aspirations, in addition to causing needless neglect in their
immediate milieus. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;We do better in N. Y. and
L.A. than we do at home,&acirc;&euro; one San Francisco editor
complained in a letter to me, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;where a mixture
of paranoia and provincialism make people deathly scared to admire
anything that doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t come out of New
York.&acirc;&euro; As provincial writers are a severely neglected
literary class, small presses outside New York are eminently
necessary; but they never get the benefits and attention that, for
the sake of literature&acirc;&euro;&trade;s future, they deserve.
As a result, not only do they rarely develop a larger, unparochial
vision of literary necessity, but so much of their very best
intentions go to waste. (A lesser disadvantage is a distance, both
physical and psychological, from the new intelligence continually
generated by New York&acirc;&euro;&trade;s artistic change and
exchange.)</p>
<p>The historical epitome here was Alan Swallow (1915-66) who
operated a one-man firm out of his own house in Denver, Colorado,
publishing small editions, cheaply printed, of largely forgotten
poets (and some better-known, commercially abandoned, older, mostly
western writers) to a negligible amount of sales and even less
reviewing response. A former football player, he worked around the
clock and for a while also taught at the local university.
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;For many of us in publishing,&acirc;&euro; he
wrote in a classic statement, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;the chief concern
is less that of seeing important work of the past continue to be
available than it is the situation for the talented new writer. We
are concerned with the poetry, the fiction, the literary criticism
of inherent significance.&acirc;&euro; Nonetheless, rare is the
small publishing enterprise outside New York that lasts as long as
Swallow&acirc;&euro;&trade;s press
did&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;twenty-five years, until his premature
death. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;He never published a book he
didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t like,&acirc;&euro; the novelist Mark
Harris explained. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Thus, he never fell into
self-contempt.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>Another exemplar of sorts has been Bern Porter (b. 1911), a
peripatetic poet and physicist, who issued numerous books that were
then otherwise unpublishable: Philip Lamantia&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
<em>Erotic Poems</em> (Berkeley, 1946), Kenneth
Patchen&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Panels for the Walls of
Heaven</em> (San Francisco, 1947), several volumes of Henry
Miller&acirc;&euro;&trade;s essays, and even Dick
Higgins&acirc;&euro;&trade; <em>What Are Legends?</em> (Calais,
Maine, 1960). In 1939, August Derleth, better known as a prolific
novelist, founded Arkham House in his native Sauk City, Wisconsin,
to publish both regional material and literary fantasy (especially
the otherwise abandoned fiction of H.P. Lovecraft); for nearly as
long, Harry Duncan&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Cummington Press has
published a steady stream of exceptionally well-printed books of
excellent poetry, including Robert Lowell&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
first book, <em>Land of Unlikeness</em> (1944), and the first
edition of Armand Schwerner&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>The Tablets 1-
VIII</em> (1969). In the forties, James A. Decker, also operating
in the Midwest, issued numerous collections of otherwise
unavailable poets such as the first book of David Ignatow. City
Lights, of course, represents yet another historical step in the
necessary decentralization of American publishing.</p>
<p>Capitalizing upon its decline, other California firms have
filled the breach in poetry publishing. The most prolific has been
Black Sparrow Press which John Martin started in Los Angeles in
1968, initially printing limited editions of younger American
poets, many of whom had not previously appeared in book
form&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;David Antin, Kenneth Gangemi, George
Economou&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in addition to older, mostly West Coast
poets descending from Black Mountain traditions. Currently doing
about twenty books a year plus a modest monthly magazine, Martin
generally prints around 1500 copies, nearly all of which are bound
in cardboard and sold for four to six dollars. The remaining two
hundred or so are bound in harder covers, signed by the author and
sold for a higher price. Unlike small publishers who depend upon
grants or private beneficence, Martin survives on sales alone.
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m doing well
(enough),&acirc;&euro; he recently wrote me,
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;making expenses and a kind of living (I have no
other income except what the press gives me); but to accomplish all
this, I have to do everything myself: editing, mailing, ad copy,
shipping, bookkeeping, correspondence, etc. It means a 70-hour
week. And my wife designs the books, which saves a big expense.
I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll continue as long as I can, publishing what
I want the way I want to do it.&acirc;&euro; Martin reports that,
like other serious small publishers, he cannot do all the titles he
would like, estimating that &acirc;&euro;&oelig;each year I must
send back 20 books I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d love to publish, but I
can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t.&acirc;&euro;</p>
<p>Another West Coast publisher, Donald Allen&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
Four Seasons Foundation, favors poets he has previously
anthologized&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Creeley, Olson, Philip Whalen, and
Michael McClure; it scored a commercial coup by publishing the
original editions of Richard Brautigan&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
much-rejected <em>Trout Fishing in America</em> (1967), <em>In
Watermelon Sugar</em> (1968), and <em>The Pill Versus the
Springhill Mine Disaster</em> (1968). Robert
Hawley&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Oyez Press did Philip
Lamantia&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Touch of the Marvelous</em>
(1966), the best book by a poet who, though famous for nearly 30
years, has never been published in the East. Dave Haselwood issued
Allen Ginsberg&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Indian Journals</em>
(1969), while Grey Fox in Bolinas published the first edition of
Ginsberg&acirc;&euro;&trade;s long-lost rhymed poems, <em>The Gates
of Wrath</em> (1972). Glide Publications, the book-making arm of a
San Francisco activist church, did <em>Mark in Time</em> (1971), an
opulently produced anthology of local poets (and their
photographs); and clearly in response, Paul
Foreman&acirc;&euro;&trade;s The Throp Spring Press, across the bay
in Berkeley, issued the <em>San Francisco Bark</em> (1972), a more
modestly produced selection of totally different poets, many of
whom teach at the local university.</p>
<p>Among the other West Coast alternative publishers are Doug
Blazek&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Open Skull whose stellar production was
Lyn Lifshin&acirc;&euro;&trade;s first collection, <em>Why Is This
House Dissolving?</em> (1968); Unicorn Press, founded in Santa
Barbara by Teo Savory and Alan Brilliant, which offers a large and
eclectic poetry list; Noel Young&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Capricorn
Press, a Santa Barbara fine-book printer, who did the original
edition of L. Clark Stevens&acirc;&euro;&trade; <em>EST: The
Steersman&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Handbook</em> (1971); George
Hitchcock&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Kayak Books which moved from San
Francisco to Santa Cruz; Ramparts Press, a spin-off from the
magazine, which issued Dave Meggyesy&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
consciousness-changing <em>Out of Their League</em> (1970) and
Murray Bookchin&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Post-Scarcity
Anarchism</em> (1971); Jan Herman&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Nova
Broadcast Press, established literally within City Lights offices,
which issued Liam
O&acirc;&euro;&trade;Gallagher&acirc;&euro;&trade;s one-man
collection of visual poetry, <em>Planet Noise</em> (1969); The
Futharc Press in Chico; John Oliver Simon&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
Galactic Approximations Press in Berkeley; Doug
Palmer&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Peace &amp; Gladness; Don
Gray&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Two Windows, Dennis H.
Koran&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Panjandrum, Stephen
Levine&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Unity Press, Coyote, Beach Books,
Cranium, Klonk, Black Dragon, Cloud Marauder, Kingdom Kum, Grape,
Stolen Paper, all of which have also resided in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Up in Bolinas, California, is David Meltzer&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
Tree Books, while down in Santa Barbara is Graham
Mackintosh&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Capra and Melissa
Albers&acirc;&euro;&trade; Christopher Books; Great Balls of Fire
in Santa Monica does photography books. Out in Sacramento was D. r.
Wagner&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Runcible Spoon; in Oakland is Oneiric
Press; in Paradise, California, is Len Fulton&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
Dustbooks which issued Wally Depew&acirc;&euro;&trade;s totally
abstract short fiction, <em>Once</em> (1971), along with the
annual, indispensable <em>Directory of Little Magazines, Small
Press &amp; Underground Newspapers</em> (1965 to the present). Up
in Oregon is Bill Thomas&acirc;&euro;&trade; Toad Press which did a
book of Ruth Krauss&acirc;&euro;&trade; striking poetry, and Don
Cauble&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Dead Angel which does some of the
handsomest hand-press book-making in America. David
Kherdian&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Giligia Press (in Fresno before it
moved to New Hampshire) issued <em>Down at the Depot</em> (1970),
an anthology of Fresno poets that is the first in a series of
comparable collections from other American cities. In Fairfax, the
Red Hill Press did <em>An Anthology of L.A. Poets</em> (1972), and
Ben L. Hiatt recently moved his Grand Ronde Press along with the
<em>Grand Ronde Review</em> (est. 1964) from Sacramento to Folsom.
Many of these smaller California presses are distributed by
Serendipity Bookshop in Berkeley which, in addition to issuing its
own titles, has also assumed the distributorship of certain books
that were abandoned by their original (commercial) publishers.</p>
<p>Not all of the new West Coast publishers, however, are primarily
literary. Straight Arrow, founded by <em>Rolling Stone</em>
magazine and headed by a literary-industrial refugee, has
specialized in pop publishing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;books designed to
exploit faddish enthusiasms and
personalities&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and that orientation informs their
few forays into literary publishing, for example, Richard
Meltzer&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Gulchur</em> (1972) and Ann
Charters&acirc;&euro;&trade; <em>Kerouac</em> (1973). The most
famous of the new Bay Area publishers, the Portola Institute,
scored on a self-help book intended for practical
usage&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<em>The Whole Earth Catalog</em>
(1969-72). Its other publications, such as the educational
periodical Big Rock Candy Mountain, continue in this vein. Other
new California publishers favor spiritual self-help (Shambala),
nature books (Sierra Club), photo books (Scrimshaw), cookbooks
(Nitty Gritty), psychological self-help (Real People), and comix.
It is books of these kinds, rather than poetry and fiction, that
New York publishers hope to find when they
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;scout&acirc;&euro; in California.</p>
<p>After Alan Swallow&acirc;&euro;&trade;s death, his press
acquired new owners who moved it to Chicago. It has since issued
several major alternative books such as Raymond
Federman&acirc;&euro;&trade;s typographical novel, <em>Double or
Nothing</em> (1971), and Eugene Wildman&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
<em>Nuclear Love</em> (1972), as well as the
latter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s path-breaking anthologies of
<em>Concrete Poetry</em> (1968) and <em>Experiments in Prose</em>
(1969). The poet Paul Carroll persuaded Follett, a Chicago
text-juvenile house, to sponsor a literary list called Big Table
Books after the magazine he had edited a decade before. It began
auspiciously with his anthology, <em>The Young American Poets</em>
(1968), and subsequently issued, among other titles, two volumes of
Bill Knott&acirc;&euro;&trade;s extraordinary poetry and prose; but
a dispute with Follett&acirc;&euro;&trade;s senior management led
to Carroll&acirc;&euro;&trade;s bitter departure and the
disintegration of the list. Another Follett executive, J. Philip
O&acirc;&euro;&trade;Hara, recently started an imprint under his
own name, while a fourth Chicago firm, Traumwald Press, was founded
to publish only one author, Dorothy Langley; but it is odd that
America&acirc;&euro;&trade;s third largest city, with all of its
cultural resources, should have so few literary publishers.</p>
<p>As New York has its small presses, so does U.S.
publishing&acirc;&euro;&trade;s second city, Boston; and among the
more prominent are Gerard Dombrowski&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Abyss in
neighboring Somerville which did Bern Porter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
<em>The Wastemaker</em> (1972) and Hugh Fox&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
pioneering <em>Charles Bukowski: A Critical and Bibliographical
Study</em> (1970); James Randall&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Pym-Randall
in Cambridge whose most auspicious effort has been
CPGraham&acirc;&euro;&trade;s book of related poems, ime (1969);
Joseph Wilmott&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Barn Dream, also in Cambridge;
and Ottone Riccio&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Hellric Press in suburban
Belmont. Milwaukee, of all places, has produced a spate of
alternative publishers, including James Sorcic&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
Gunrunner, Karl Young&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Ziggurat/ Membrane,
David Burge&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Harpoon Press, Morgan
Gibson&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Morgan Press, Tom
Montag&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Monday Morning, Martin J.
Rosenblum&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Albatross, among others. Not only
does the most persistent small-press reviewer, Rich Mangelsdorff
(b. 1943), live there, but Montag and Burge have combined to
publish <em>Margins</em> (est. 1972), a monthly review of
alternative publications. A Milwaukee refugee living in New York,
the Reverend Frederic A. Brussat (b. 1942), started <em>Cultural
Information Service</em> (est. 1970) which, though supported by the
Lutheran Church of America, is responsive to the intelligence of
the counter-culture.</p>
<p>Perhaps the oldest major rural literary press is Jonathan
Williams&acirc;&euro;&trade; Jargon Society which follows its
founder-poet in commuting between North Carolina and Lancashire,
England. Its distinctions include the first edition of Buckminster
Fuller&acirc;&euro;&trade;s long-unpublished <em>Untitled Epic Poem
on the History of Industrialization</em> (1962) and a pioneering
collection of Russell Edson&acirc;&euro;&trade;s much-admired
fables, <em>What a Man Can See</em> (1969). Sumac Press, which
emerged from a defunct northern Michigan magazine, has published a
series of fine poetry books that includes Michael
Heller&acirc;&euro;&trade;s especially impressive <em>Accidental
Center</em> (1972), and Ithaca House has put out a conceptually
comparable series of handsome paperbacks of previously uncollected
poets. In Ann Arbor, Carl R. and Ellendea
Proffer&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Ardis Publishers has produced
impressive books of Russian literature and criticism in both the
original language and English translation, in addition to an
awesomely hefty periodical, <em>Russian Literature
TriQuarterly</em> (est. 1971).</p>
<p>Among the other notable U.S. small presses are Stone Marrow,
also in Ithaca; Times Change in Washington, New Jersey, which has
an ecumenically radical outlook; Artists&acirc;&euro;&trade;
Workshop in Detroit which was run by John Sinclair before his
unjust imprisonment; John Gill&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Crossing Press
in Trumansburg, New York; Gregory Smith&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Atom
Mind in Syracuse; the Institute of Further Studies in Canton, New
York; Robert Bly&acirc;&euro;&trade;s The Sixties Press which has
concentrated upon translations; Harvey Brown&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
Frontier Press in West Newbury, Massachusetts; Burning Deck in
Providence, R.I. whose key work is Rosmarie Waldrop and Nelson
Howe&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Body Image</em> (1970); Alan
Sondheim&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Press, also in Providence; Stephen
Goode&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Whitson in Troy, N.Y. which did Hugh
Fox&acirc;&euro;&trade;s critical book on <em>The Living
Underground</em> (1970); Charioteer and Some of Us, both in
Washington, D. C,; Ernest and Agnes Tedlock&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
San Marcos Press in Cerrillos, New Mexico; Albert
Drake&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Stone Press, in Oskemos, Michigan;
Jonathan Greene&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Gnonom in Lexington, Kentucky;
the Ashland Poetry Press in Ashland, Ohio; Richard
McConnell&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Atlantis and Andrew
Wylie&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Telegraph Books, both in Philadelphia;
Georgakas&acirc;&euro;&trade; Smyrna Press in Glen Gardner, N.J.;
Zeitgeist in Saugatuck, Michigan; Jerry Patz&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
Despa Press in Northampton, Massachusetts; John
Jacob&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Two Bags Press at various midwest
addresses; and Eric Grienke&acirc;&euro;&trade;s exceptionally
prolific Pilot Press in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Among the foreign
publishers issuing American work, mostly avant-garde, are Beau
Geste Press in Devon, England, which is run by graduate students in
American studies; various European art galleries which have a
book-publishing tradition scarcely imitated in America; and Centro
de arte y communicacion in Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>Also in the cultural hinterlands are university presses which,
recognizing both the opportunity and the need, have published
poetry and sometimes fiction. Wesleyan University Press has been
the pioneer here, building up one of America&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
most substantial poetry programs in less than fifteen years; and
this success has perhaps persuaded the book editors at the
universities of Massachusetts and Pittsburgh to field more modest
poetry lines. The University of Illinois Press has issued new
fiction as well as poetry, including Paul
Friedman&acirc;&euro;&trade;s first-rate collection of stories, And
<em>If Defeated Allege Fraud</em> (1971). The University of
California scored a commercial coup not only by reviving all of
Kenneth Burke&acirc;&euro;&trade;s books into a uniform paperback
series, but also by publishing the initial edition of Carlos
Castaneda&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>The Teachings of Don Juan</em>
(1968) which its author, then a graduate student, reportedly felt
would be too esoteric for a commercial house and too unscholarly
for a standard university press.</p>
<p>Since university presses have tax-exempt status, they are a
public trust whose cultural responsibilities ought to include the
decentralization of book publishing and, thus, the issuance of
regional, if not local, writers whose works are ignored by the
metropolitan firms. For one thing, regional
publishing&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;books written by and for members of a
non-cosmopolitan community&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;remains one of the
biggest gaps in the spectrum of literary-intellectual
communication. Indeed, since the network of American universities
rather than New York or Boston is paradoxically the closest
semblance of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;an intellectual
center&acirc;&euro; that this country has, book publishing ought to
emulate American cultural reality rather than the reverse.
Nonetheless, as Charles Newman has observed:</p>
<p>The university press, as a countervailing institution, has
failed utterly to provide a genuine alternative press or
distribution system. It has favored exegesis over art, and
generally ignored the culture of its time. It has not created a
single innovation in production or distribution technology, despite
massive subsidy and proximity to all the research facilities
necessary. It has been timid editorially, conservative politically
and esthetically. It has failed to serve even the day-to-day
educational needs of its own community (except to certify certain
academic hiring and promotion policies) and ignored any audience
beyond its narrowest constituency. It has passed its costs, in the
form of outrageous cover prices, on to its basic consumer, the
library, which in turn has passed them on to the government. And
when the economic crunch comes, ... the first things to go are the
poetry series, the literary reviews, the search for the unexpected
imagination, all these &acirc;&euro;&oelig;luxuries&acirc;&euro;
whose constituency is never represented on policy-making
boards.</p>
<p>So it seems, alas. If commercial publishers are most interested
in making money, while editorial decisions at small presses reflect
love (which can be esthetic, political, spiritual, or personal), so
publishing at university presses reflects people with various
levels of power within a hierarchy, apportioning spoils within a
budget.</p>

<p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve declined partnerships, mergers, and

&acirc;&euro;&oelig;The Poets of Broadside Press: A Personal
Chronicle&acirc;&euro; (1970)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many alternative publishers, like little magazines, gather the
work of minorities that have found the larger houses unresponsive
to their work. In this sense, the avant-garde constitute one
literary minority; the young, as noted before, comprise another
neglected class. Black writers, a third, have founded several
literary presses, including Joseph Okpaku&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
Third Press in New York; the Third World Press in Chicago which
issued the especially perspicacious essays of the scholar-critic
George L. Kent, <em>Blackness and the Adventure of Western
Culture</em> (1972); Alfred E. Prettyman&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
Emerson Hall in New York; Jihad Productions which Imamu Amiri
Baraka (ne LeRoi Jones) founded in Newark, N.J.; and Yardbird
Publishing Co. which opened with <em>The Yardbird Reader</em>
(1972), an exceptionally fine anthology compiled by Ishmael Reed.
Perhaps the best-known of the black literary publishers has been
Dudley Randall&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Broadside Press in Detroit
which has put out Gwendolyn Brooks&acirc;&euro;&trade; most recent
large collection, as well as pamphlets by Don L. Lee, Etheridge
Knight, and Sonia Sanchez. Enterprising in other dimensions as
well, Broadside has issued both poster poems (at fifty cents
apiece) and a series of poets&acirc;&euro;&trade; tapes, along with
distributing the booklets of American black poets that Paul Breman
publishes in England. A sometime librarian and factory worker,
Randall was a literary late bloomer, starting Broadside at the age
of fifty in 1964, and he continues to run it out of his own house.
Johnson Publishing Co., with its base in <em>Ebony</em> and related
magazines, has published more popular books which are, like its
magazines, destined for a large black audience; but in its
avoidance of literary publishing, Johnson&acirc;&euro;&trade;s book
division, again like its magazines, imitates the white
literary-industrial complex.</p>
<p>Chicano writers have founded their own publishing houses such as
Quinto Sol in Berkeley which did Nick C. Vaca&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
particularly literate book of fiction, <em>El Espejo</em> (1969),
and Mictla and Barrio, both of which are in El Paso, Texas.
Activist women have founded several companies: The Feminist Press
at S.U.N.Y.-Old Westbury, Long Island; Know, Inc., in Pittsburgh;
Shameless Hussy, run by a woman known only as Alta in San Lorenzo,
California; and Adele Aldridge&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Magic Circle in
Riverside, Connecticut. The success of the Jewish-American movement
suggests that a once-excluded group can be only as strong as its
literary organizations.</p>
<p>Canadians constitute another minority suffering discrimination
in the North American literary scene because their writings have
always suffered neglect. Since nearly all major Toronto publishers
are subsidiaries of American firms, they operate largely as
extensions of the U.S. literary-industrial complex, importing books
from south of the border rather than initiating their own. As J.
Michael Yates observed:</p>
<p>It is virtually impossible to find a Canadian paperback on a
Canadian newsstand [because] newsstand distribution in Canada is
exclusively American-owned and controlled. The only way a Canadian
book can discover itself on a Canadian newsstand is via New York,
where it would have to come out as a newsprint paperback from one
of the big paperback houses.</p>
<p>Even in commissioning Canadians to do books for themselves, the
editorial-industrial subsidiaries betray their immediate culture.
David Godfrey and James Lorimer noted that,</p>
<p>The main impact of foreign ownership upon a Canadian subsidiary
seems to be that all the Canadian employees become fixated,
nervously guessing at what it is that head office would like to see
them doing, and then nervously trying to do it. Their main
reference point becomes the big-time U.S. head-office people....
Occasionally, of course, the control with ownership is not so
gently exercised.</p>
<p>For several reasons, then, those Canadian writers who did not
expatriate to the south or to England have long been founding their
own firms; and that probably explains why Canada has more small
presses per capita than the United States. According to Wynne
Francis, the earliest notable Canadian small press was First
Statement, established in the forties by John Sutherland in
Montreal; and its successor there in the fifties was Louis
Dudek&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Contact Press which was far more
prolific and ambitious, surviving well into the sixties. The
Fiddlehead Press, also established in the fifties in New Brunswick,
set a precedent for subsequent regional publishing; it remains a
prolific publisher of English-speaking poets residing in the
Maritime provinces. The consequential Canadian small presses of the
early sixties included John Robert Colombo&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
Hawkshead, James Reaney&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Alphabet, Nelson
Ball&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Weed/Flower (which continues to publish
Americans as well), Seymour Mayne and Patrick
Lane&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Very Stone House in Vancouver, William
McConnell&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Klanak, also in Vancouver, Ganglia
and Gronk in Toronto, and Upbank in Quebec.
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Most of the books privately printed or
published by the little or private press,&acirc;&euro; Francis
testifies, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;are not reviewed in [Canadian]
newspapers and magazines.&acirc;&euro; And that, of course, is
scandalous.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, younger Canadians, recognizing that necessity is
more inspiring than practicality, have recently established several
important book-publishing ventures, all of which are open to young
writers, some of which are hospitable to experimental works as
well, most of which also belong to the recently founded Independent
Publishers Association. The most striking books have come from The
Coach House Press, now run by a cooperative (which had assumed Stan
Bevington&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Coach House print shop). Known as a
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;printer&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
press,&acirc;&euro; Coach House publishes books in an incomparable
variety of formats, in sum suggesting that each text was
individually designed rather than fit into a pre-determined mold.
Back in 1967, it broke new terrain with
bpNichol&acirc;&euro;&trade;s bp, whose three parts are a
forty-eight page booklet with a long poem, a phonograph record of
Nichol declaiming two extended sound poems, and fifteen
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;visual concrete poems and objects.&acirc;&euro;
Coach House has since done Bill Hutton&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>A
History of America</em> (1968) which Leslie A. Fiedler singled out
as his favorite work by a young American; M.
Vaughn-James&acirc;&euro;&trade;s book-length surreal fiction,
<em>The Projector</em> (1971); and Nichol&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
<em>Two Novels</em> (1969). It also prints <em>Image Nation</em>,
an especially elegant photographic periodical.</p>
<p>The House of Anansi in Toronto was set up by David Godfrey and
Dennis Lee, respectively a novelist and poet, and its earliest
titles included their own books. It has since issued several
anthologies of new writing each selected by a different editor (a
wise policy); a series of inexpensively produced first novels; fine
book-length poems by George Jonas and Margaret Atwood; the first
large collection of Bill Bissett&acirc;&euro;&trade;s experimental
poetry; critical books on Canadian writing by both Atwood and
Northrop Frye; and a long, awesomely complex first novel by Chris
Scott, <em>Bartleby</em> (1971), that I regard as one of the very
best fictions of recent years. Also in Toronto are The New Press,
which published Vaughn-James&acirc;&euro;&trade;s earlier visual
fiction, <em>Elephant</em> (1970); Peter Martin Associates; Griffin
House, which did an especially brilliant record of Canadian sound
poetry, the Four Horsemen&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Canadada</em>
(1972); James Lewis &amp; Samuel, which issued <em>Read
Canadian</em> (1972), a polemical bibliographical guide; Neewin,
which publishes &acirc;&euro;&oelig;on Indians by
Indians&acirc;&euro;; and the Playwrights Co-op, founded early in
1972, whose cheaply printed scripts cope with the fact that
shockingly few new Canadian plays have previously been available in
print. David Godfrey, having sold his share of the House of Anansi,
recently founded Press Porcepic in rural Erin, Ontario; and Oberon
Press, established in Ottawa, filled a need by issuing
bpNichol&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>The Concrete Chief</em> (1970),
an intelligent anthology of Canadian experimental poetry.</p>
<p>Delta Canada, founded in Montreal in 1965 also by Louis Dudek,
has since moved to La Salle, Quebec, where Glen Siebrasse currently
directs it; and the best books of Ladysmith Press, also in Quebec,
are those of its proprietor, Sean Haldane. Disposable Paper Press,
also in LaSalle, Quebec, recently founded a mimeographed periodical
devoted to Little Magazines/Small Presses (est. 1973). M.G. Hurtig
Ltd., an Edmonton bookseller, did Al Purdy&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
<em>The New Romans</em> (1968), an influential anthology of
anti-U.S. diatribes (which, it seems, Toronto publishers avoided
like the plague); Talonbooks in Vancouver is a cooperative society
specializing in experimental Canadian west coast authors. Sono Nis,
founded by an American expatriate who has since become a Canadian
citizen, J. Michael Yates (b. 1938), grew out of the writing
programs at the University of British Columbia. Initially favoring
local writers, it has published anthologies of British Columbian
writing, along with several of Yates&acirc;&euro;&trade;s own
works, including his best fiction, Man in the Glass Octopus (1968),
and books of poetry and fiction by several other recent immigrants
to Canada. The most striking of its recent anthologies has been
<em>VOL VOX: Poetry from the Unofficial Languages of Canada</em>
(1972), which is to say languages other than French and English.
(Similar collections of literature in America&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;unofficial languages&acirc;&euro; could also be
compiled, but U.S. publishing has so far neglected this
opportunity.) Recently retiring from academia, Yates moved his
press to the Queen Charlotte Islands off the coast of northwestern
Canada. It is unfortunate that neither Sono Nis books nor those by
other new Canadian publishers are ever reviewed south of the border
because most of these authors, like those in the States, write for
all of North America.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Another kind of book publishing necessary now is an
authors&acirc;&euro;&trade; collaborative where risks and costs are
spread among the participants who then constitute its board of
directors. Though much discussed, usually with reference to the
success of the Magnum group in photography or certain European
cooperatives, this has never been tried in any substantial way in
America. One explanation is that U.S. writers, unlike European, are
unaccustomed to collaborating with each other, partially because
each regards himself as being in continual competition with all of
his peers. A more modest analogy in this vein is the anthology that
makes a book out of the best work done by artist-writers of similar
commitments, or with comparable problems, or by a circle of
friends, or by members of a long-term class in creative
writing.</p>
<p>Particularly to cope with the pervasive neglect of experimental
writing, I co-founded (along with the writer Henry James Korn,
later joined by the designer Michael Metz) an annual
<em>Assembling</em>, as we call it, which we designed as an open
format for &acirc;&euro;&oelig;otherwise unpublishable&acirc;&euro;
creative work. We realized that since the principle of editorial
authority per se has been the primary obstacle of expressive
freedom, our first radically purposeful move was the elimination of
our own discriminatory prerogatives. Where other editors seem to
have trouble relinquishing authority, we found it easy; instead of
soliciting manuscripts for editorial decision, we have asked
writers and artists known to be doing unusual or otherwise
unpublishable work to contribute 1000 copies, 81/2&acirc;&euro; by
11&acirc;&euro;, of no more than four different pages of whatever
they wanted to include. In this instance,
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;publication&acirc;&euro; consists of binding
all the submitted sheets into a thousand finished books.</p>
<p>Since innovative writers in particular will, under current
circumstance, need to learn publishing from the beginning, it
seemed a good idea to ask each <em>Assembling</em> contributor to
be responsible for the printing of his own
work&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to become his own self-publisher, so to
speak. This has been easier than it seems, for not only do
academics have access to xerox machines, but certain offset and
Itek processes can commercially print one side of a thousand sheets
for less than ten dollars and both sides for less than fifteen. In
return for their contributions, <em>Assembling</em> agrees to give
three copies to each collaborator (forty-two in the first issue,
ninety in the third), and we sell the rest to reimburse our
expenses. Simply by its compositional process, <em>Assembling</em>
realized a commitment to unhindered communication, creative
possibility, and artistic seriousness similar to that instilled by
other comparably composed volumes, such as Dana
Atchley&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Notebooks</em>, done in 1970 and
1971 in Vancouver, and Jerry Bowles&acirc;&euro;&trade; one-shot
<em>Art Work, No Commercial Value</em> (1972), both of which,
unlike <em>Assembling</em>, tend to print more graphics than
literature. Not only do such easily imitated enterprises implicitly
render editorial authority obsolete, but the whole book represents
what artists and writers can realize if granted genuine expressive
freedom.</p>
<p>The existence of so many new publishers is just one reason why
we need new reviewing media; but not until the late sixties did
they appear. <em>The Book Review</em>, founded by Jay Bail in San
Francisco, started auspiciously, expanding steadily for two years,
refusing advertisements, ignoring the hyped-up trash, reviewing
small-press publications, attacking the cultural establishments.
However, by the following year, both it and its editor disappeared
as mysteriously as they arrived, and the review did not reemerge
for another year, a ghost of its former self. <em>University
Review</em>, founded in New York by Steve Roday, was designed to be
a monthly supplement inserted free in university newspapers.
However, since the magazine drew its income not from sales but from
publishers&acirc;&euro;&trade; advertisements, its editors felt
obliged to riddle its issues with hyper-fashionable names in order
to impress not potential readers but literary-industrial
advertising managers; unfortunately, the
superstars&acirc;&euro;&trade; slick words provided a peculiar
contrast to the predominantly undergraduate reviewers. With
editorial offices in the shadow of Columbia University,
<em>University Review</em> was also responsive to the winds of
classroom fashion, as well as pressures from an older generation,
represented more immediately by local professors. In spite of all
this Podhoretzian ambition, the review declined until 1972 when it
disappeared for a six-month vacation. Reemerging the following fall
as a tabloid that sold on newsstands, <em>UR</em>, as it was now
called, discovered Radical Chic several years too late, at the
price of ignoring books several years too soon.</p>
<p><em>University Review</em>, like <em>The Book Review</em>, was a
good idea unfortunately mismanaged. The losers are not only their
editors, but those readers likely to be interested in alternative
books. Until better critical media emerge, the best way to learn
about small press books is through the annotated catalogs regularly
issued by their distributors&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the Book People and
Serendipity, both of which operate out of Berkeley, and the Book
Organization in Millerton, New York.</p>
<p>There will surely be more alternative publishers in North
America as more and more literary people realize the exigencies of
necessity. This survey scarcely mentions all the new imprints that
currently exist. Some are omitted because of my ignorance; others
because their output strikes me as sub-literate or thoroughly
coterie&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;small editions issued less out of any
pressure of quality or esthetic principle than narcissism strong
fellow-feeling. One outlet of this sort, the Tyndall Creek Press of
Allston, Massachusetts, told the Fulton-May Directory that,
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Our editions to date have been poems by members
of our own editorial circle.&acirc;&euro; Coterie presses rarely
have more impact than coterie magazines, unless they publish a
writer whose work transcends their mass; but rare in practice is
the coterie press that has any impact at all.</p>
<p>Substantial books&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;those that present good
writing; those that would change a reader&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
intelligence&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;are more commendable than those
that do nothing either for their publisher or their readers. It was
the great English poet-designer Eric Gill who distinguished private
presses, those that print what their editors choose, from public
presses, which by definition publish what their audiences seem to
demand. However, between these two criteria stands a third
measure&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;what the literary situation requires. In
my judgment, even a publisher as superficially narrow as Something
Else becomes, by virtue of what it does, a sharper cutting edge for
the future of intelligent writing. One trouble common to many other
new publishers is that the kind of anti-establishment courage that
must have informed their initial purposes does not govern their
current editorial decision-making that tends to be safe and
circumscribed.</p>
<p>All this activity is good and necessary; and if only because the
habits and economics of this literary-industrial
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;closed enterprise system&acirc;&euro; are so
cruelly contrary to their heroic efforts, all new publishers
deserve a hero&acirc;&euro;&trade;s support from everyone concerned
with the future of writing and reading. Serious young authors would
naturally prefer a similarly new publisher sharing the risk and
whatever profits with a true extension (and equal) of themselves;
and more than one I know gladly took no advance for a new book, try
as they otherwise might to fleece a conglomerate. Many poets
published by large houses also allow small-press editions of their
new work, in part because certain care and freedoms are available
in smaller editions, but also because their presence on a new
firm&acirc;&euro;&trade;s list bestows a sense of solidity. As
every small publisher is offered more good books than he can afford
to do, the success of his current production brings a further
loosening of the bulging dam, and perhaps enough favorable
precedent to inspire yet another imprint. The survival of more
avant-garde publishers would insure that the public fate of writers
working in experimental ways will not depend upon one firm (or only
one man). In this example, as in others, small publishers bring
diversity, regionalism, and decentralization to the channels of
literary communication; and these principles demand, in turn, a
succession of modest, though interlocking initiatives. Now is the
time, let it be commonly understood, for alternative
publishing.</p>
<p>Even though small presses have carved a distinguished tradition,
their achievements are scandalously omitted from the standard,
institution-minded (rather than book-minded) histories of American
publishing whose authors overlook as well the reasons why small
presses might ever exist. (Indeed, it seems odd that several
histories of little magazines have appeared while the small presses
are still disregarded.) The first volumes of most of this
country&acirc;&euro;&trade;s major poets were issued by small firms
which continue to bring out more consequential poetry (and
experimental writing) than all the larger firms combined; and
unless the literary-industrial complex changes its present policies
on fiction publishing, the impetus on this genre will probably also
shift to smaller firms. Now is the time, to repeat, for alternative
book-making.</p>
<p>Not only do the achievements of alternative publishers deserve
more scholarly-critical recognition, but their publications must be
bought and read. Unless certain cultural enterprises get sustained
support, they simply cannot survive; and the changes implied by
their existence surely will not happen. When one of them dies, we
cannot forget, some of the circumstances prerequisite not only for
the articulation of minority consciousness, but also for the
survival of literature, pass away too.</p>
