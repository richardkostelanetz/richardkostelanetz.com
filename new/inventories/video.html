NTSC 3/4â€ U-Matic or NTSC VHS 1/2â€     cassettes can be supplied from, and should be returned to, the artist at the     above address. Fees are negotiable. All public performances should be reported     to ASCAP or its European affiliates. A single asterisk (*) identifies tapes     that have a hi-fi stereo soundtrack; those with a double asterisk (**) would     benefit from large-screen projection TV; those with a triple asterisk (***)     are also available in the historic 1/2â€ reel to reel. The works fall into     distinct groups:</p><ol>    <li> Tapes whose screen content is exclusively linguistic: Kinetic Writings       (1989, 22â€™) consists of mute language realizations, of both poems and fictions,       that exploit capabilities unique to video. Video Strings (*, 1989, 29:42)       offers seemingly endless streams of overlapping words, enhanced in different       ways, with one example in German. Stringsieben (1989, 12â€™) has a different,       more spectacular continuous realization of the continuous German text. Turfs/Grounds/Lawns       (*, 1989, 23â€™) has successions of four-word poems, eight-word poems and       sixteen-word poems, sometimes accompanied by aural realizations of the same       texts. Partitions (*, 1986, 27:40) offers long words in which shorter words       are embedded, in increasingly complex configurations. Onomatopoeia (*, **,       1989, 23:00) displays on screen in increasingly complicated visual arrays       the text of RKâ€™s sampler-produced audio composition of words whose sound       represents their meaning. Two versions of Kaddish (*, 1991, 23:00) displays       on screen a nonsynchonous English translation of the soundtrack of the Hebrew       prayer for the dead, spoken in various styles and accents reflective the       Diaspora. </li>    <li> Video fantasias of audiotracks produced at sophisticated electronic music       studios: AMERICASâ€™ GAME (**, 2001, 60â€™), of and about the sound of baseball       as a reflection of life in the Americas; INVOCATIONS (**, 1988, 61â€™), of       and about the sound of the language of prayer. [This is available with six       different openings: (a) English; (b) Latin; (c), German; (d) HebrewAssyriac;       (e) Italian-Yugoslav-Greek; (f) Swedish-Danish.] The Gospels Abridged (*,       **, 1988, 61â€™) has parts of the four opening books of the New Testament       heard as a continuous fugue. Die Evangelien (*, **, 1989, 58â€™) is the same,       wholly in German. Seductions (**, 1988, 25:30) has sixteen complimentary       stories, interwoven one sentence at a time, all spoken by RK, his voice       amplified in various ways. Relationships (**, 1988, 31:45) is an elaborate       intimate memoir. Two Erotic Videotapes (1988, 56:10) offers different video       syntheses of the two preceding audiotapes. Two Sacred Texts (**, 1988, 12â€™)       has differing video accompaniments to two audiotapes: Praying to the Lord       and The Eight Nights of Hanukah. Eight different realizations to the former       alone (*) are also available towards an eight-monitor installation. The       images in these recent tapes were produced at the Experimental TV Center,       Owego, NY, and edited at Real Art Ways, Hartford, CT. The Eight Nights Of       Hanukah has that compositional alone, accompanied by computer-generated       variations on the Star of David. </li>    <li> Recent departures: Home Movies Reconsidered: My First Twenty-Seven Years       (1987, 46â€™) is an edited critical interpretaton of 8 mm film taken between       1937 and 1967. (Presently silent, it functions best as the basis of a live       performance.) Americasâ€™ Game (1988, 60â€™) has representational imagery accompanying       a soundtrack of and about sounds, including language, unique to baseball.     </li>    <li> Early works, mostly to texts that preceded involvement with video: Three       Prose Pieces (***, 1975, 20â€™) has imagery indigenous to video, as produced       during a residency at Synapse, Syracuse University: (a) Excelsior (1975,       1:05) switches rapidly between two voices and two shapes seducing each other,       the spoken words eroticizing the abstract imagery. (b) Plateaux (1975, 3:55)       relates the stases of a love affair in one-word paragraphs, the screen showing       an evolving moire pattern whose languid circularity complements the circularity       of the verbal narrative. (c) Recyclings (1975, 14:05) is an incremental       sequence of nonsyntactic prose texts (drawn from a 1974 RK book of that       title, reissued in 1984) that are read by several nonsynchronous, identical       voices (all RKâ€™s). The image consists only of pairs of lips (likewise RKâ€™s),       moving synchronously with audible speech, the differences in hue indicating       the age of the image. The first section has one voice and one pair of lips;       the last (and sixth) section has six voices and six pairs of lips, each       generation of lips-voices reading the same nonsyntactic text nonsynchronously.       Openings &amp; Closings (***, 1975, 56:10), also produced during the Synapse       residency, draws upon a book of that title, published in the same year,       in which single-sentence stories are alternately the openings and the closings       of hypothetical longer fictions. The author is seated in a chair reading       the Openings in color and the Closings in black-white, with each new image       as different as can be from the one(s) before, ideally realizing visually       the leaps in time and space that characterize the boosts text. Literary       Video (1977) has four bits of alternative literary recital: (a) A bearded       mouth reading the title piece, a 1976 manifesto about video is a propitious       medium for literary ideas (b/w, 5:â€™45). (b) Milestones in a Life (1977)       with dark male eyes that hardly blink, while the soundtrack broadcasts a       story about a bourgeois life that is told in terms of numbers followed by       single-word paragraphs (b/w, 14:10). (c) Dialogues (1977) with three, dramatically       different exchanges of the words Yes and No, in which only a hirsute Adamâ€™s       apple is visible (b/w, :30, :35, :40). (d) Plateaux (1977) with only the       side of a face that is reciting a story whose single-word paragraphs relate       the evolution of an affair (b/w, 3:32). Declaration Of Independence (1979,       9:20) has four pairs of superimposed bearded lips, each visibly different       in size, reading RKâ€™s contemporary â€œDeclaration of Independence,â€ roughly       simultaneously, from beginning to end. From time to time an explanatory       gloss, in capital letters larger than those of televised movie subtitles,       crawls along the bottom of the screen. Epiphanies (1980, 31:00, b/w) nas       single-sentence stories, produced entirely on a character-generator, that       are the epiphanies, which is to say resonant moments that illuminate the       entire (but here nonexistent) story. Early Literary Videotapes is a single       120â€™ NTSC VHS with copies of Literary Video, Three Prose Pieces, Openings       &amp; Closings, Declaration of Independence and Epiphanies. Video Writing       (1987, 53:40) is an informal retrospective about this early work and the       environment behind its production, narrated by RK and directed by Robert       Boynton Weyr. </li></ol>  <p>Also available are videotape copies of RK works originally produced in other     media: Epiphanies (1980, 44:20) documents the initial performance of the theatrical     version of the single-sentence texts mentioned before, now directed by Suzanne     Bennett with four readers at the University of North Dakota, March, 1980.     Epiphanies (1981, 48:45) documents a different performance, this with several     readers declaiming perhaps three times as many stories, directed by E. St.     John Villard at Vassar College, October, 1981. Epiphanies (1982, 29:35) copies     a film whose visual track contains clips of various lengths that have this     same epiphany quality. On the soundtrack are voices reading stories that,     typically, have no connection, other than similar form, to the visual track.     Epiphanies (1983, 19:50) copies a film that no longer exists, broadcast over     German television, with a wholly German soundtrack and sections different     from those in the English film noted above. Broadcast rights for German-language     television must be obtained from SFB. Five Versions Of Epiphanies (1988, 32â€™)     has excerpts from the four previous â€˜tapes, as well as the video version,     mentioned before, for character-generator. Ein Verlorenes Berlin (1983, 21â€™)     copies an imaginative film documentary about Berlints Great Jewish Cemetery     as the principal surviving relic of â€œA Lost Berlin.â€™ The visual track has     current scenes from the Cemetery; the soundtrack has the voices of Berliners     remembering, in German, the cemetery and its relation to the Berlin they knew.     A Berlin Lost (1985), which won a prize at the Ann Arbor Film Festival (and     later toured with it), has the same footage, to the same length, now with     ex-Berliners speaking English with different testimony. Ett Forlorat Berlin     (19814) has a soundtrack of Swedish-speaking Berliners with yet other testimony.     Berlin Perdu (1986) is the same footage with a fresh French soundtrack. El     Berlin Perdido (1987) is Spanish; Berlin Sche-Einena Jother (1988) is Hebrew.     Various combinations of two Berlin films on 3/4â€ tape, or even more films     on 1/2â€ VHS tape, can be made for appropriate reasons. Constructivist Fictions/Openings     &amp; Closings (198~4) copies two early b/w films of texts of RK books with     the same titles.</p>  <p>If any sponsors wish to audit copies, inquire about fees, sponsor future     video work or ask any other questions, please write me at the address at the     top of this page.
