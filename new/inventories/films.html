These are six     versions of the same documentary footage, made in collaboration with Martin     Koerber of West Berlin, co-produced with Literarisches Colloquium Berlin,     with six different, wholly fresh soundtracks, respectively in English, German,     French, Swedish, Spanish, and Hebrew accompanying the same footage. The Great     Jewish Cemetery of Berlin (Weissensee) is seen as the principal surviving     evocation of the greatest years (1860-1940) of German's principal city. In     this visual history, the Cemetery and its suggestive gravestones become an     archaeological window into a Berlin, not only Jewish, that, alas, no longer     exists. The visual track has current scenes from the Cemetery. On the soundtrack     is the authentic testimony of ex-Berliners remembering the Cemetery and the     world represented there. Since the gravestones already provide so much to     read, we chose not to sub-title the film (or to allow the affectations of     overdubbing), but, instead, used the more authentic, if unusual, principle     of reproducing the film with wholly new soundtracks composed from fresh interviews     with ex-Berliners. Not only because the soundtracks differ in content, but     because the imagery begs to be reseen, our recommendation is that, especially     for sophisticated audiences, at least two versions be seen in sequence. (For     the films other than English, we can provide printed sheets of rough translations.).     The films have been screened on my personal tours where I also answer questions     about it and Weissensee. These 21' films are available in 16 mm optical track     or 16 mm magnetic track (from your nearest Goethehaus), 3/4&quot; U-Matic     cassettes (both NTSC and PAL) and 1/2&quot; VHS cassettes, for rental or purchase.     Koerber, along with Michael Maassen and myself, also produced a 65-minute     radio feature <em>Nach Weissensee</em> that has been broadcast over German     stations and favorably reviewed in the German press.</p>  <p><strong>Epiphanies</strong> (1981-93). On the soundtrack are heard my single-sentence     stories that are meant to be the epiphanies, or resonant, illuminating moments     of otherwise nonexistent fictions. Read by numerous voices, these stories     have no ostensible connection to each other, other than similarity in esthetic     kind, and no ostensible connection either to the visual track which has unconnected     clips of various lengths that have the same epiphanic quality. What results     from these abundant collection of visual and verbal stories is the exhaustive     experience of the experience of fiction. This film, in progress for several     years now, is available in several forms. 1.) Footage, 29:35, presently without     sound, which can be played in conjunction with audiotapes in either English     or German. This is available on both 16 mm film and 3/4&quot; NTSC U-Matic     cassettes. 2.) A 20-minute U-Matic NTSC cassette of a different version (whose     film no longer exists), with an entirely German soundtrack. 3.) A four-hour     videotape that is available on VHS or U-Matic cassettes with a fixed soundtrack     mostly in English but including some parts in German, Chinese, and Vietnamese.     4.) A series of 10 to 20-minute films that could be printed, support willing,     with soundtracks in either English or German; these would work best as a sort     of nonserial serial shown in conjunction with a sequence of other films in     a standard projection venue. My own recommendation is that the longest version     would work best with an audience that could leave and return to it, say as     an installation in a museum or a public space.. Various versions of <em>Epiphanies</em>     have been screened at the Arsenal (West Berlin), the Donnell Library (NYC),     the Anthology Film Archives, and over the North German television network.     This can also be shown with the videotape realization of <em>Epiphanies</em>     in which the stories appear on the television screen in various typographical     arrangements produced by me on an electronic character-generator.</p>  <p><strong>Constructivist Fictions</strong> (1978). Symmetrical line-drawings,     seen in negative, change in systemic sequence. The system informing these     changes may be additive, reductive, permutational or combinational, among     other syntactic techniques. One recurring theme is variation and development     within a systemic constraint. Produced in collaboration with Peter Longauer,     now a well-known commercial animator, with a soundtrack by the composer Jon     Gibson, this film was made on an animation stand, but is unlike any animation     seen before. For images this draws upon two of my books of visual fiction:     <em>Constructs</em> (WCPR, 1975) and <em>Constructs Two</em> (Membrane, 1978).     5:30 in length, it is available on 16 mm optical track and a 3/4&quot; NTSC     U-Matic cassette. This film has been screened at Global Village and the 25th     Festival Mondial du Cinema de Courts Metrages (1985), where it received an     honorable mention in the &quot;Classe Independant.&quot;</p>  <p><strong>Openings &amp; Closings</strong> (1976-78). Single-sentence stories     are either the openings or the closings of otherwise nonexistent fictions.     All that appears on the screen are the words, with the openings as black letters     on a white background and the closings as white letters on a black background.     Since the soundtrack has continuous classical piano, the film evokes recollection     of silent movies and, within that context, could be considered &quot;all titles,     no action.&quot; This draws for its text upon my book of the same title (D'Arc,     1975). 15:30 in length, this film, made in collaboration with Barton Weiss,     has been screened at the University of Texas, Global Village (NYC), Anthology     Film Archives (NYC), Hamline College (St. Paul), and the Western Front (Vancouver),     among other places. It and <em>Constructivist Fictions</em> also toured with     <em>Wordsand</em> (1978), a traveling retrospective of my work with words,     numbers and lines, in several media.</p>  <p><em>&quot;When we say expanded cinema, we actually mean expanded consciousness.     Expanded cinema does not mean computer films, video phosphors, atomic light     or spherical projections. Expanded cinema isn't a movie at all: like life     it's a process of becoming, man's ongoing historical drive to manifest his     consciousness outside of his mind, in front of his eyes. One no longer can     specialize in a single discipline and hope truthfully to express a clear picture     of its relationships in the environment.&quot; <strong>--Gene Youngblood,     Expanded Cinema (1970)</strong></em></p>  <p>Films in progress, seeking support, include â€œNew York City,â€ a montage of     images unique to my hometown, fused to a 140' electro-acoustic tape composition     of the same title (that expands an earlier, shorter tape of the same title,     initially produced for Westdeutscher Rundfunk) and â€œInvocations,â€ a universe     of sacred images, to complement the remixed version of another electro-acoustic     composition, 60 minutes long, broadcast by public stations around the world     and currently available, in an unrevised form, on a Folkways record. Both     projects are meant to explore Moholy-Nagy's vision of &quot;a true opto-acoustic     synthesis in the sound film. ... The 'documentary sound film' and the 'abstract     sound film' will be reinforced by the 'montage sound film', by which must     be understood not merely montage of the optical and acoustic sections, but     a mutually integrated montage of both. We ought to begin with a series of     experiments in the sound element.&quot; Longauer and myself are also working     on â€œA Life in New York City,â€ likewise proposed to be 60 minutes long, that     would resemble the Berlin films in regarding current architecture as reflective     of past life, in this case my own, to my narration.</p>  <p>Related work includes books, videotapes, audiotapes, and holograms, some     of which complement the films.
