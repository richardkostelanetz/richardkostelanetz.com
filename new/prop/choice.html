To my mind, the initial measure of the success     of any of my poems/stories/works of art is their distance from what is already     known (and what everyone else is doing). A related measure, in my own mind,     is a sort of audacious unacceptability.</p>  <p> It is not unreasonable to characterize my way of working as experimental,     which is to say that I often start with a conscious hypothesis, a radical     premise, that will shape my creation and, incidentally, insure that the resulting     work will be radically unusual. In the pieces collected here, it can be observed     that I have tried to discover whether it would be possible to make:</p>  <ol>    <li> poems not with syntactical structures but individual words that are visually       enhanced;</li>    <li>a poem composed of overlapping words, so that each new word would contain       at least three letters of its predecessor;</li>    <li>skeletal fictions whose paragraphs have no more than three words that       are not syntactically sequential;</li>    <li>fictions composed not of words, the traditional material of literature,       but abstract, geometric drawings and, in another example. photographs;</li>    <li>fictions composed of overlapping words;</li>    <li>a film that does not &quot;adapt&quot; an unusual literary text (Epiphanies)       but duplicates visually and aurally its scrupulously disconnected form;</li>    <li>video art composed exclusively of electronic lettering and holograms likewise       composed only of words;</li>    <li>poems that depend upon the discovery of short words within longer words;</li>    <li>minimal fictions no more than three words in length and often less;</li>    <li>ballets that are meant to be read, even if never performed;</li>    <li>animation scenarios that are meant to be read and seen, even if never       filmed;</li>    <li>texts of continuous words that are not syntactically related.</li>    <li>other unconventional moves that are not so easily defined, some of which       may have escaped my memory, others of which I may not be so fully aware.</li>  </ol>  <p> Perhaps the most puzzling departure is the numerical work, which is really     not as forbidding as it looks initially. In Two Intervals, for instance, it     can be observed that every number relates to those adjacent to it, either     vertically or horizontally, by the interval of either one or three, plus or     minus (bearing in mind that, in this ten-digit system, nine plus one is zero,     or one minus three is eight). To &quot;read&quot; such pieces, it is true,     one must be numerate, just as the prerequisite for reading poetry is literacy.     One heuristic question to ask of this and other numerical works of mine is     whether it is poetry or fiction or something else--perhaps an art composed     exclusively of numbers, which is to say a numerical art? Though the work is     original, it is not obscure--not at all; indeed, here and elsewhere the work     reflects a taste for conscious propositions, rational procedures, and verifiable     perceptions.</p>  <p> Another departure is experimenting with literary abstraction, or discovering     whether an idea so acceptable in modern visual art and music can be applied     to literature. After working for over a quarter century in this way, I still     find it odd that sophisticated people who can understand painterly abstraction     without blinking can sometimes claim, when confronted with my versions of     its literary analogy, that such work is &quot;meaningless&quot; or &quot;trivial&quot;     or some other pseudo-critical obscenity. To such objections there are, of     course, two sides; for if they were not made, that silence would indicate     to me that this (or any other) work of mine should, in principle, be destroyed     as unacceptable.</p>  <p> Especially in America, writers who do conventional poetry and fiction customarily     limit their &quot;writing&quot; to the medium of print; but perhaps the fundamental     experimental hypothesis behind my creative career has been discovering not     only whether initially literary ideas can work in audio or video or film but,     more important, whether I can work, either as the sole artist or as an equal     collaborator, in media other than printed pages. And by so doing what no other     writer is doing (or has done), I hope to expand our sense of what is possible     not just in art but in imaginative literary life.</p>  <p> One quality I wish for my activity, as well as individual works, is that     they be neither common nor predictable (except perhaps for their capacity     to surprise), and yet make sense in retrospect. </p></div>
