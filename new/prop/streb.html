The MacArthur fellowship that she received in 1997 is one sign of this     recognition; another is her international touring throughout the United States,     Canada, Europe, and Australia. Though she has recently presented her pieces     at the Joyce Theater in New York, she has also explored such alternative venues     as a platform beside the boardwalk at Coney Island and the beach in Miami..     Choreographing since 1979, she founded in 1985 her company, called simply     Streb.. In her current brochures, she prints five epithets that define her     art: â€œRicochet, Crash, BreakThru, Catapult, Air Hurdle.â€ </p>	  <p>The first radical idea was the use of props not as extensions, as Alwin Nikolais     had done, but as resistances. So her dancers crashed into walls and wooden     planks and dove fist-firstthrough a pane of glass. More recently acquiring     two world-class trampolines, she is exploring possible movements for dancers     suspended in mid-air. My sense is that out of post-Merce Cunningham avant-garde     dance come two directions--one emphasizing alternative movements within a     dance tradition, the other incorporating nondance activities for dancers.     If Mark Morris for one represents he former, Streb epitomizes the latter.     Early in her career she received from Cunninghamâ€™s lifetime collaborator John     Cage this mash note: â€œWhen I first saw Elizabeth Strebâ€™s wori, I was exhilarated.     Her energy, inventiveness, uninterrupted <em>attentionaire</em> are great.     Every time I hear that she is dancing, I arrange to see her work.â€</p>  <p> What I would like to do is the first book that would tell of her life, his     esthetic, and the development of her art, with photographs and other documentation.     It can be done to any length and size the publisher thinks appropriate. For     a sample may I offer a revision of this appreciative article done for <em>Brooklyn     Bridge</em> magazine.</p>  <h2>Introduction to ELIZABETH STREB </h2>	<p>    The floor of the choreographer Elizabeth Strebâ€™s recent rehearsal space resembles     a playground with mats on the floor and, above them, a variety of large apparatuses     on which to climb and swing. The initial, radical idea of Strebâ€™s dance is     the use of props not as extensions of oneâ€™s body, as Alwin Nikolais used them,     but as resistances. So her dancers collide with walls, fall face down onto     mats, perform inside boxes in which they canâ€™t stand up, and resound off trampolines.     Strebâ€™s dance is very physical, to be sure, but itâ€™s also inventive and engaging.</p>	<p>    Streb herself is a solidly built woman in her mid forties, medium in height,     with under-kempt dark red hair. Dressed in black gaucho pants with a black     shirt, she looks less like an artist who recently won one of the most coverted     MacArthur Fellowships than a gym teacher. Indeed, since her associates are     adults, rather than kids, her indoor studio resembles an eccentric â€œhealth     clubâ€ more than a dance studio or a playground. As they performed, she screamed     spontaneous instructions from the sidelines, much like a solicitous coach.     It is not for nothing that her ensemble is called Ringside.</p>	  <p> Born in Rochester, Streb attended local Catholic schools, buying not a car     but a motorcycle as soon as she could obtain a driverâ€™s license, and then     SUNY-Brockport, where she majored in dance. Coming to New York in the 1970s,     she took additional dance lessons and performed in other choreographersâ€™ companies.     After some stunning solo performances, she started her Ringside in 1979. A     few years later John Cage, never a pushover for enthusiasm, gave her a classic     mash note, which read in part: â€œWhen I first saw Elizabeth Strebâ€™s work. I     was exhilarated. Her energy, inventiveness, uninterrupted <em>attentionaire</em>     are great. Every time I hear that she is dancing, I arrange to see her work.â€     Since then her company has toured the world, performing in such venues as     the Coney Island boardwalk and the mall outside the Smithsonian in addition     to theaters and museums. They have filled New Yorkâ€™s premiere dance venue,     the Joyce, for three-week seasons usually around Christmastime.</p>	  <p> The classic Streb piece in my memory is <strong>Surface</strong> (1993)     where two 100-pound, door-sized planks of wood lay on a padded floor. Two     dancers raise the planks up to be nearly vertical, so that two other dancers     can hurl their bodies at the planks that then fall backwards to be picked     up again while the two performers scamper off the mats. The process is repeated     with other pairs of dancers. The pieceâ€™s accompanying music, the entire background     sound, is the amplified noises of performers and boards, Matthew Ostrowskiâ€™s     sound design, here and elsewhere, enhancing the impression of violence. The     piece customarily runs seven minutes. Iâ€™ve seen it several times already and     would love to see it again.</p>	  <p> The great recent work is <strong>Punch the Jump</strong> (1999) which is     performed on two large, world-class trampolines, placed one immediately behind     the other, with high ledges on the two short sides. The dancers jump onto     the apparatus in various configurations, from various angles, and then leap     into the air, sometimes repeatedly, before exiting onto the ledges or front     mats. The ways in which they fall onto the trampoline, often in pairs or trios     (which is contrary the solo trampoline technique), is continually inventive     and kinetically striking. Performing mostly in the dance is an old dream of     modern choreography, epitomized by Peter Pan, but Streb realizes it not for     a single dancer but a group, with no strings attached, incidentally illustrating     her radical contention that â€œreturning to the floor is the biggest obstacle     to the advancement of action. I like to break Newtonâ€™s laws a lotâ€</p>	  <p> <strong>Punch the Jump</strong>, even more than <strong>Surface</strong>,     is about trajectories, which has become the ultimate theme of Strebâ€™s danceâ€”not     movements, not poses, not couplings, not elegance, not stories, not even steps     to accompany pre-existing music. Nearly all the dance (and all the sound)     results from executing an aggressive physical task, such as falling, tumbling,     or colliding; key terms are velocity and impact. In this emphasis on trajectories,     Ringside resembles the circusâ€”not only the three-ring Barnum but the more     sophisticated Cirque de Soleil, whose choreographers have reportedly known     Strebâ€™s work for years.</p>	<p>    Look at the audience at a Streb performance and you see mouths dropped in     awe, much as they are at the circus. It looks hazardous, much as the circus     looks dangerous; but dancers rarely get hurt. Two differences between the     touring circus and Ringside is that Strebâ€™s performances are more austere,     especially in costuming, lighting, and sound; they are less dependent upon     virtuosity. Streb doesnâ€™t mind revealing that her performers strain and sweat,     as indeed they do. Her pieces are more inventive than competitive gymnastics     which is typically a limited set of moves performed ad nauseam.</p>	<p>    In addition to working with her company, Streb and her associate artistic     director Hope Clark have conducted workshops called â€œKid Action,â€ where â€œchildren     work with a movement which is natural to them and discover a technique which     develops out of a need to perform the movement safely, rapidly, slowly, in     different sequences and against different surfaces.â€ Her performances this     past summer included a short piece on a single mat by prepubescent kids. A     variation of â€œKid Actionâ€ is â€œExchange Events,â€ especially in touring universities,     for adult-sized people.</p>	  <p> Other Streb pieces include <strong>Flying Machine</strong>, in which Hope     Clark dons a harness in an upright spinning apparatus that propells her in     the air around an axis while several performers do counterpoint movements;     and <strong>Breakthru</strong>, a stunning new conceit in which Clark propells     herself through a pane of suspended glass, falling to the floor milliseconds     before the shards do. â€œDonâ€™t blink,â€ Streb advises. â€œIt happens in a split-second.â€     This last piece especially must be seen to be believed.</p>	<p>    Streb, her companion the writer Laura Flanders, and I once went together to     Gleasonâ€™s Gym on Brooklynâ€™s Front Street for an eveningâ€™s card of amateur     fights. Prior to the official events, we walked among the rinks noticing the     wrestlers practicing their pratfalls. (Listen for a single thud, we told each     other; if you hear more sounds, someone might have fallen wrong.) During the     fights Streb drew in her sketchbooks. One woman boxer was so adept that Streb     wished she could be recruited for Ringside. As long as you donâ€™t care who     wins, I told her, this resembles your dance in that people perform against     resistances, not only of each other but the ropes and the floor.</p>	<p>    As we left Gleasonâ€™s, we noticed it was around the corner from the Brooklyn     Bridge Anchorage, where Ringside had been the sole artist-in-residence a few     summers ago, where Streb used a space thirty feet high to suspend her dancers     in harnesses enabling them to spin in the air as they bounced off a wooden     wall from whose top they were suspended. No one working at the Anchorage thought     to tell her that literally a short distance away was Brooklynâ€™s premiere boxing     facility, where much of the choreography incidentally resembles her own.  </p></div>
