However, once I     made notes about experiences to include in my novel, I began to hear voices     telling particular stories; and since I have recently been producing so much     radio, I decided it would be best for me to work initially with authentic     voices.</p>  <p>My initial themes were two: The 1960s was a special time as other decades     were not, and then that it was special in more ways than we commonly remember     or understand. While I did not want to neglect the political protest commonly     associated with the period, my principal interest was episodes of "anonymous     history," to use Sigfried Giedion's phrase--dimensions of experience that     remain invisible or forgotten, even though, in this case, they occurred only     two decades ago. So in selecting participants to interview, I looked first     of all for individuals who had either personal experience or expert knowledge     of some specialness in this period. Thus, I have a pharmacology professor     talk about the last age of drug optimism, during which, in his most prominent     example, valium sales peaked at 75 million prescriptions, only to become by     now half of what they were; a math professor to remember the rise and fall     of the "new math"; the manager of an investment fund to talk about the stock     market boom of the middle sixties and then about how, because of values predominant     in the period, he felt more comfortable not displaying his wealth, again unlike     now; a fashion writer to talk about the radical changes in female dress and     the current persistence of these changes. And so on.</p>  <p>In selecting interviewees, I also looked for another quality--voices so distinctive     that they need not be reintroduced. This was necessary because I wanted not     to make a conventional radio feature, with an announcer (probably a celebrity)     identifying speakers and making connections, but an informal symposium in     which the remarks of various individuals would be interwoven as though they     were participating in a continuous conversation. My assumptions were that     the speakers would establish their authority not through an announcer's identification     of their current positions (or even their names) but through the authenticity     of their articulated memories and perceptions, and then that this authority     could be extended, in a listener's mind, to their subsequent appearances on     the tape. I also wanted to let sophisticated listeners, like those of public     radio stations here, make their own connections from the testimonies.</p>  <p>For the pilot of <strong>A Special Time</strong>, I personally conducted     over three dozen interviews, initially with old friends, and then with new     friends, such acquaintance accounting for why the speakers sound as though     they are talking to someone familiar. These interviews were necessarily transcribed,     because one disadvantage of audiotape, unlike film, is that there is nothing     to see. Since words seen are easier to organize than words heard, the tapes     had to be transcribed. Studying these transcriptions, I decided which passages     to excerpt for the opening 60-minute feature and then in which order those     excerpts should go. My aim was to compose an associational flow, as though     each new participant were extending what had previously been said, and then     to introduce many of the topics that would be developed in individual hour-long     programs later in the series. Many speakers were edited to sound clearer,     more fluent and more interesting than they actually were; so that this testimonial     from an early listener is partially an implicit tribute to our artifice: "There     are a lot of people on this tape I wish I knew."</p>  <p>Once in a private eight-track studio, I decided to distribute these participants     over the stereo spectrum; and since six separate tracks were available to     me for speech, there were, so to speak, six seats from which they would speak:     on a metaphorical clock at 9:30, 10:30, 11:30, 12:30, 1:30, and 2:30. In the     remaining two tracks of multitrack tape, I placed music and historic sounds     mostly from the period as a kind of counterpoint that could be acoustic or     thematic or both. Most of these background sounds extend over at least two     monologues, bridging the natural pauses between successive speakers. Since     moments when music and speech pause together were rare, we had to mix in live     time the eight tracks of sound down to the more accessible two tracks of a     stereotape. All in all, we worked over thirty hours in this studio simply     to produce the rough draft of an illusion of a fluent hour-long conversation     accompanied by appropriate background sounds.</p>  <p>Though I already have enough testimony on tape to compose several more hour-long     conversations on individual topics such as politics, manners, values, enterprise,     culture, learning--research and the War, I expect to do yet more interviews,     many during my tours as a visiting artist/lecturer, hopefully discovering     yet more "hidden history." The plan is initially to remix the pilot, eliminating     imperfections, and then produce either a dozen more hour-long programs or     a single program several hours long (ideally for a special comparable to say,     the 25th anniversary of the JFK assassination and then for release on a single     hi-fi videocassette). One element I enjoy about this project is its reawakening     my training in American history (M.A., Columbia University) and earlier curiosity     about innovative historiography, now all at the service of my more recent     interests in the artful organization of speech and sound.</p>  <p>Need I say there is evidence is all around us for continuing interest in     the 60s as the most significant of recent decades, as reflected in many areas     of our culture: Movies, popular music, fiction, clothing, and political debate.     The critical and popular success of the "Vietnam" series on public television     illustrates the continuing appetite for analysis and recall of this period     in American life. Nonetheless, there have been no comprehensive oral histories     of decade since Walter Cronkite's contemporaneous updating of Edward R. Murrow's     decade-by-decade <em>Hear It Now</em>, a three-record set (CBS) of narrated     newsclips that by contemporary standards seems stylistically primitive. That     is the vacuum that <strong>A Special Time</strong> aims to fill. Interested     sponsors should please contact. Thank you.</p>  </div>
