After the talk I will gladly answer questions     and listen to stories, at least to place individual incidents in larger contexts,     perhaps to advise. This lecture draws upon articles published in various places     over the past two decades and in The Grants Fix.</p>  <p>2) John Cage and Moholy-Nagy as Polyartists, with slides and audiotape. As     the descriptive title implies, this will demonstrate how works in various     arts reflect common esthetic principles particular to each major figure.</p>  <p>3) Innovative Literature in America Today, likewise with slides and audiotape,     focusing not only upon visual and aural literature but upon radical departures     in language style and literary structure.</p>  <p>4) Writing Extended, also with slides and tapes: A comprehensive introduction     to my own work in poetry, fiction, audiotape, videotape, photography, holography,     and film.</p>  <p>5) Audio Writing, an introduction to my own work with audiotape, with many     short examples and live commentary. Longer works of my Audio Art available     for concerts include Invocations (in 25 languages, for 61 minutes); The Gospels     (in English, 120 minutes, or in German as Die Evangelien, 60 minutes); New     York City, which comes in two lengths--one 60' international version, the     other a 140' American version, both composed of sounds particular to my hometown,     which can be played in conjunction with an elaborate slide presentation involving     hundreds of comparable New York City images. These works are particularly     effective in sequence and in daytime venues.</p>  <p>6) The Radio Art of Glenn Gould--an introduction, with audiotape, to the     remarkably unknown &quot;docudramas&quot; produced by the great Canadian musician.</p>  <p>7) Epiphanies, which is the collective title for a multimedia work of single-sentence     stories whose text is available for an exhibition or theatrical presentation     and on a film, a videotape, an audiotape, parts or all of which can be used     in either a single presentation, a series or an installation.</p>  <p>8) Numbers: Poems &amp; Stories: My most popular show, with slides and commentary,     of my art composed entirely of numerals--given in other fifty venues over     the past few years.</p>  <p>9) A Berlin Lost/Ein Verlorenes Berlin/Berlin Perdu/Ett Forlorat Berlin/El     Berlin Perdido/Berlin Sche-Einena Jother, my six 21Â¹ films with different     soundtracks, respectively in English, German, French, Swedish, Spanish, and     Hebrew, of authentic testimony about the Great Jewish Cemetery of Berlin as     the principal surviving represention of pre-WWII Berlin and its greatest years.     These films are best shown in sequence, as the imagery begs to be reseen.     I can provide printed English translations for those films not in English.     When I show the films myself, I can answer questions about the cemetery and     these stylistically unusual documentaries (e.g, devoid of talking heads).     The films themselves are available from Goethe House for screening without     me; videotape copies also exist in 3/4&quot; and 1/2&quot; VHS formats.</p>  <p>10) A John Cage Circus, to which I can bring a large number of 6 &amp; 8-hour     audio-only hi-fi stereo VHS tapes containing a complete survey of Cagean performance,     in addition to some video about Cage in which I appear. This is best presented     simultaneously in several acoustically separate spaces, some of which may     include lie performances of CageÂ¹s work prepared in advance by associates/students     of the sponsor. I will be centrally available to answer questions, etc.</p>  <p>11) Visual Poetry &amp; Visual Fiction: Another traditional slide show, with     voice-over narration, of my own early exploratory work--likewise given over     fifty times.</p>  <p>12) The American Tradition of Radio Drama, which suggests, with taped examples,     that, while we had little radio drama on the Anglo-European model, we had     instead something they lacked, radio comedy, whose principal practitioners     discovered the unique possibilities of radio art.</p>  <p>13) Gertrude Stein as the Great American Person of Avant-Garde Letters: The     only utterly straight lecture, with neither slides nor audiotapes, that I     can be persuaded to give.</p>  <p>Wordsand, my small exhibition of language art in various media, is still     available for touring, having already visited several institutions in the     past few years. It includes prints (already matted, but needing covering frames),     book-art books, audiotapes, videotapes and a film. I am also putting together     an exhibition, more suitable for libraries than galleries, of the more than     three dozen Anthologies I have edited over the past few years.</p>  <p>I am in general willing to visit classes, particularly if I can discuss works     I have done or am doing. (See enclosed resume.) For all concerned, a series     of presentations, stretching over a few consecutive days, is worth more than     just a single shot. My fees can be characterized as mid-range and, of course,     become less per day for extended stays; but bear in mind that just as some     artist/writers teach so that they can do other things for nothing, the firmest     base of my sporadic income is touring.</p>  <p>Sponsors in New York State can get supplementary funds from Poets &amp; Writers,     72 Spring St., New York, NY 10012 (212-226-3586); for my concerts including     my tapes from Meet the Composer, 2112 Broadway, New York, NY 10023 (212-787-3601).     Sponsors in other states, as well as New York, should consider approaching     the appropriate departments of the NEA for further supplementary funding.     Bear in mind that these organizations must be contacted well in advance of     my presentations for funds to be made available.</p>  <p>Past sponsors of over two hundred presentations have included art museums,     alternative spaces, cultural centers and university departments of literature,     art, music, speech, media, intermedia, American studies and combinations of     them, as well as student organizations. My social security number is 059-32-4341.     If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask; and if you don't hear from     me at once, the best assumption is not that I'm dilatory but that I'm on tour     and will get back to you as soon as I return. I look forward to your response.</p>  <p>Cordially yours, Richard Kostelanetz </p></div>
