D. Hirsch, and Harold Bloom, among others,     may I propose to write a book of approximately 250 pages with approximately     two dozen black and white illustrations. Going beyond the exclusively literary     bias of all these books, I would propose that literacy in our time should     include familiarity with more than classic books; it should encompass as well     basic knowledge of visual art in all forms, music both classical and popular,     dance, sports, and the new intermedia arts. Contemporary literacy is not complete     without discriminative knowledge of history, science, social science, and     new technologies, beginning with computers. More practically, literacy should     include the ability to read machine manuals along with experience at reading     novels. My thesis is that no one is truly literate unless he or she aims for     competent knowledge in all these areas. (The contrast is partial literacy     represented by Hirsch and the two Blooms--a partial literacy that becomes     increasingly limited in our culturally richer times.) Since this book will     be written in my most accessible style, Iâ€™d like to think it could become     a best-seller in the wake of the books noted above.</p>  <p>Most of Contemporary American Literacy will have chapters on different areas,     outlining with choice examples various dimensions of basic literacy. My principal     recurring theme in understanding any intellectual discipline or art is that     each is about issues and histories unique to it. Simply, a new work of painting,     say, becomes important for its contribution to a perceived tradition of painting,     not for the â€œtruthâ€ of its â€œcontent.â€ Knowledge and experience of the best     past endeavors is the principal prerequisite for perceiving new work in any     field, including, say, new machine manuals. A second theme holds that genuine     literacy depends upon discrimination and thus a knowledge of excellence. It     isnâ€™t enough that one knows something about a â€œfieldâ€; it is more important     to master what is best in each discipline and know why. A third theme dear     to me is that no area of knowledge is intrinsically superior to any other,     which is to say that no art or field of endeavor is necessarily less accessible     than any other--each does the Lordâ€™s work in different ways. (Since Iâ€™m not     a professor of this or that, I have no privileged reason to tout one discipline     as primary knowledge.) A fourth theme is that literacy in America today is     necessarily different from classical, European, or Oriental literacy. I find     it important that most educated people, if presented with these four themes,     agree with them.</p>  <p> The practical issue becomes how to deal with these themes in a book. After     a critique of partial literacy in our time, I would broach basic literacy     in several areas, focusing upon masterpieces. For an epigraph I might use     this from Harold Bloom: â€œThe Canon was (and is) formed by the great writers     themselves, who work in the mode of their precursors (thus canonizing them)     and are in turn canonized implicitly by the great writers who come after them,     and are influenced by them.â€ I like this formulation because even though it     reflects Bloomâ€™s commitment to only bookish literacy, the principle is applicable     to many areas from visual arts to mathematics to sports (where great new performance     is acclaimed precisely because it enhances as it reflects previous superior     performance).</p>  <p> Noting how many young people develop basic intellectual discipline through     enthusiasms for one or another kind of mass culture, such as popular music     or sports, it might be interesting to start the book with a chapter on sports     literacy, which involves of course a familiarity with the precise achievements     of the major performers. I would conclude the book with advice on organizing     knowledge, beginning with note-taking and filing. If this book succeeds, I     could imagine it contributing to the discussion of curriculum in America.     In contrast to Hirsch and the two Blooms, who seem more concerned with distinguishing     Ins from Outs (in schemes reminiscent of Esquire chartings of the American     literary scene), I wish to denigrate not individuals or their works but limited     modes of literacy.</p>  <p> As I think of myself as literate in most of these areas, having written     about nearly all of them at various times, most chapters will be my introductions     to excellence, focusing upon various individuals and achievements of the first     rank. I plan to write as one literate adult speaking to another and concluding     with useful bibliographies. In those few areas problematic to me, such as     mathematics and computer/machine manuals, I may incorporate the advice of     colleagues. I imagine a book of 20 chapters, each 5,000 words in length. It     should be dedicated to the memory of Marshall McLuhan, who, though he was     personally bookish, taught me about the insufficiences of bookish literacy     in our times.</p>  <p>In the following outline, Iâ€™ve noted possible chapters and left a few open     for discoveries made in the course of writing (e.g., food and drink):</p>  <h2>TENTATIVE OUTLINE</h2>  <ol>  <li>Contemporary American Literacy</li>  <li>     History, emphasizing such masterpieces as Edward Gibbonâ€™s The Rise and     Fall of the Roman Empire and Richard Hofstadterâ€™s American Political Tradition.</li>  <li>    Sports, focusing upon such great sportsmen as Babe Ruth, Julius Erving,     Bobby Hull, Pele, et al. (which is to say the guys who revolutionized their     games)</li>  <li>    Poetry, featuring Walt Whitman, T. S. Eliot, and E. E. Cummings, among     others</li>  <li>    Fiction, discussing Miguel de Cervantes, William Faulkner, Jorge-Luis Borges,     Gertrude Stein</li>  <li>    Theater, with Shakespeare. Samuel Beckett, nonliterary performance</li>  <li>    Exposition, with Michel de Montaigne, Charles Lamb, H. L. Mencken</li>  <li>    Music, with J. S. Bach, W. A. Mozart, Charles Ives, Duke Ellington</li>  <li>    Visual Arts, with Islamic art, Michelangelo, the moderns.</li>  <li>    Dance, with Isadora Duncan, Fred Astaire, Merce Cunningham</li>  <li>    Film, with D. W. Griffith, Buster Keaton, contemporaries</li>  <li>    Architecture, from the Parthenon to Frank Lloyd Wright, Buckminster Fuller,     and the works of the best contemporaries</li>  <li>    Television/Video, with Ernie Kovacs, and recent video artists, such as     Nam June Paik</li>  <li>    Polyartistry, with Wm. Blake, L. Moholy-Nagy, John Cage</li>  <li>    Social Science, with Thorstein Veblen, Margaret Mead</li>  <li>    Science, with Galileo, Albert Einstein</li>  <li>    Machine Manuals, with those for VCRs, computers, automobiles</li>  <li>    Mathematics, with Descartes, Henri PoincarÃ©, Alfred North Whitehead, Benoit     Mendelbrot</li>  <li>    Philosophy/Theology, with St. Thomas, H. Niebuhr, L. Wittgenstein</li>  <li>    Organizing Knowledge and Realizing Literacy, or how to make the most intelligent     use of the information you acquire	</li>	</ol>	    <p>After taking degrees in cultural history, I have at one time or another written     about all the arts, in addition to other cultural areas, and that my home     library, once featured on the front page of the NY Times Thursday Home section,     includes several thousand books, several hundred records and audiotapes, and     hundreds of videotapes. Most of the research for this book has already been     done in the course of my professional work; most of it can be written from     resources immediately at hand. Were the book contracted soon after the receipt     of this proposal, I would expect to deliver a completed manuscript within     two years.  </p></div>
