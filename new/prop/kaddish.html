I and a student assistant taped at least sixty different     declamations of these hauntingly beautiful traditional verses from rabbis     and cantors descending from places around the world, the sounds (accents)     of their voices implicitly representing the scope of the Diaspora (the revelation     of which becomes my plot and theme). These were initially mixed into a stereo     tape to fulfill a commission for German radio. That was only the first step.     What we want to do next is produce an eight-track tape for eight loudspeakers     theatrically arrayed (and for more modest venues, a four-speaker version as     well)--an electronic opera for repeated concert performances and/or continuous     installations that ideally also include a videotape, either for standard monitors     or a large projection screen, containing imaginative presentations of an English     translation of the text and related nonrepresentational imagery. In all cases,     the speakers will made to sound, as they do on the sample tape, as though     they are participating in a live performance.</p>  <p> I prefer producing audiotape, whether for radio broadcast or disc or a continuous     performance, to live theater for several persuasive reasons: (1) it would     be unfeasible (and extravagantly expensive) to gather religious professionals     into a single presentation space; (2) it would, on the other hand, be inappropriate     to have such prayers spoken by &quot;actors&quot;; (3) on multitrack audiotape     can be realized a complex verbal-musical-theatrical experience of a permanent     quality that would be impossible in live performance (product being more important     to me than process); (4) sacred texts, to my senses, especially benefit from     metahuman acoustic enhancements; (5) the completed performance can be distributed,     less expensively, in its definitive form forever, initially as a stereo audiotape     to Westdeutscher Rundfunk, which commissioned it, and to publishers of standard     records and discs but also (in stereo, four-track or eight-track forms) to     public venues such as museums, theaters and synagogues for regularly repeated,     if not continuous, performances; (6) the result, unlike a live performance,     offers equal access to all listeners. Ever since producing books about alternative     performance theater (1968) and Moholy-Nagy (1970), I've been interested in     finding an operatic analogue for an entirely &quot;mechanical theater&quot;     that would proceed apart from human intervention; the development of multitrack     audiotape makes this strategically feasible. &quot;Kaddish&quot; represents     my first major attempt to realize a work in this vein.</p>  <p> A repeatable performance medium would be more appropriate for a work such     as this, a work whose content is extremely subtle and whose narrative action     is conceptually unusual in form: The linguistic representation of the Diaspora     is portrayed not through changes in the text but through the appearance of     different voices revealing various backgrounds. Most of my field recording     was done in New York City (my home town), where rabbis and cantors from around     the world permanently reside, and throughout Europe, where I am invited to     work every year; and need I say that the Hebrew prayer for the dead is safely     in the public domain. The stereo audiotape was realized at the brand-new Opus     digital editing console at Lexicon, Inc., in Waltham, MA; final composition     of four-track and eight-track tapes will take place at EMS-Stockholm, where     I have worked gratis at a twenty-four track console several times before,     or at a comparable private American studio. For both concert performances     and continuous installations, I expect to produce an accompanying videotape     which will resemble the sample <em>Onomatopoeia</em> (1990) in having a visible     text composed to illustrate the verbal content of the audiotape; the typography     and visual recitation will be my own. Aside from assistance in recording rabbis     and editing videotape, I have been and will be personally involved in every     step of the financing, creation and distribution of this work.</p>  <p>    The multitrack Kaddish will be offered to exhibitors that have previously     presented films and tapes of mine, including the Jewish Museum and the Whitney     Museum, for multispeaker + video presentations in either concerts or continuous     installations; WDR will also probably use it in its own performance festivals     comparable to the one recently at the Whitney at Equitable in New York City.     It might also be possible to use this Kaddish as the sound for a live theatrical     performance that, say, could include mime or dance, much as the choreographer     Manuel Alum used my Invocations (1981) for performances both in Rio Piedras,     PR (1985) and New York, NY (1986).</p>  <p> May I add that it seems odd to me that we have not had more musical-theater     for audiotape in our time, as we are more accustomed to the strictly aural     experience of musical theater than we commonly allow, initially on radio and     then on records; so that we could estimate that by now more operatic theater     is just heard, rather than seen and heard. Moreover, in Europe as well as     America, operas have been written especially for radio theater (by Walter     Goehr in 1930, Gian Carlo Menotti in 1939, Italo Montemezzi in 1943, among     others); but prior to the age of audiotape, their original performances were     necessarily produced within the constraints of live time. However, in the     post-WWII period came audiotape, which can be spliced more cleanly than the     preceding technology of wire; and multitrack tape, which allows the composer     to separate the component sounds and readjust them individually for a definitive     stereo-spatial performance; and then sound-processing capabilities, such as     filtering or more sophisticated computer speech-synthesis. More recently came     videotape, with its own capabilities, including the possible use of mixed-down     multitrack audiotape for its stereo soundtrack. In this context, it is clear     that the most immediate predecessors for what I plan to do are the electro-acoustic     soundtracks of two videotapes: Charles Dodge's <em>The Story of Our Lives</em>     (1974), subtitled &quot;An Operatic Dialogue for Male and Female Synthetic     Voices,&quot; and Robert Ashley's <em>Perfect Lives</em> (1984). Indicatively,     both these soundracks are also currently available just on audio-storage media     (aka cassetes). My own Kaddish for audiotape will thus be not for an elite     but for a larger audience, which is to say most of us millions who are, individually     as well as collectively, accustomed just to hearing musical-theater. May it     also stand perhaps as a pioneering example for future musical-theater initially     on audiotape. My deepest ambitions for this proposal, need they be known,     are to create a truly contemporary successor to the grand tradition of sacred     musical- theater and, second, to realize only the second classic electro-acoustic     audiotape of an Hebraic text [the first being, alas, Karlheinz Stockhausen's     <em>Gesang der Junglinge</em> (1955)].</p>  </div>
