  <p><br />
    After I die, I hope that my executors will publish a book of my proposals, 
    to reveal what could (and perhaps should) have been done.--R. K., &quot;Person 
    of Letters in the Contemporary World&quot; (1989).</p>
  <p>~AN ANTHOLOGY OF CRITICAL ESSAYS ON &quot;MASTERS OF MODERN LITERATURE&quot;~</p>
  <p>An appropriate supplement (or precursor) to my ~On Contemporary Literature~, 
    which will appear next year, this anthology will contain extended critical 
    essays on each of the dozen foremost writers of our time. The purpose of this 
    collection is twofold: on one hand, to introduce the writers and, on the other, 
    to provide those who have read their work with the finest short critical essay 
    available. The writers I chose to include are Samuel Beckett, Bertolt Brecht, 
    Albert Camus, T. S. Eliot, William Faulkner, Franz Kafka, James Joyce, Nikos 
    Kazantsakis, Thomas Mann, Alberto Moravia, Boris Pasternak and Jean-Paul Sartre. 
    The final volume, as I envision it, will have twelve chapters of critical 
    essays and a brief introduction. At the end of each essay I plan to include 
    a selected bibliography of other important critical works; as a footnote to 
    the first page of each essay I will put a short intellectual biography of 
    the critic. The essays are between thirty and thirty-five pages apiece (at 
    approximately four hundred words per page), so the final volume should be 
    roughly four hundred pages. I would plan to pay up to two hundred dollars 
    apiece for the reprint rights, though several essays, I am sure, would cost 
    much less. Experience tells me there is usually no trouble in purchasing reprint 
    rights for literary criticism; still, if for some reason one or another essay 
    should be unobtainable, I have alternate choices. As all essays are currently 
    available in English, there are no translation problems. I see the typical 
    purchaser of this book as the college or high school student; very likely 
    this book will become assigned reading in courses on modern writing.</p>
  <p> To fulfill the double purpose of this book, each essay selected should perform 
    two tasks. To a reader unfamiliar with the writer's work, it should convey 
    some idea of his style, his themes, his major preoccupations, his virtues 
    and defects and his place in contemporary literature. To those who have already 
    read his major works, the essay should lead to a better understanding of that 
    literature. From my survey of critical writing, I find that two kinds of essays 
    best satisfy these needs. The first is a survey of all the writer's works 
    in which the critic comments upon each one, developing themes through individual 
    discussions. This type of essay succeeds, I have found, when it eschews the 
    demands of a rigorously unifying thesis on one hand and minute textual analysis 
    on the other. In the second type, the critic develops several themes through 
    a discussion of a writer's technique and his vision of the world. The critic 
    will refer to his individual works, but the critical comments do not focus 
    upon the particular achievements of each book. For major writers who tended 
    to repeat themselves, such an essay can work better than a survey (see Erich 
    Heller on Franz Kafka or Eric Bentley on Bertolt Brecht). On the other hand, 
    I have avoided as critically useless those newspaper book reviews that are 
    not designed to enrich anyone's appreciation of the work and then plot summaries 
    that simplify the surface in lieu of probing the depths, as well as those 
    narrow-focused, generally difficult academic pieces that do not present a 
    broad view of an author's work. Likewise, since this is an anthology of literary 
    criticism, biographical essays, such as pieces on Faulkner's mysterious life 
    or Brecht's political activities, are not included.</p>
  <p> In the brief introduction I discuss the criteria I used in selecting the 
    twelve writers: (1) Must have published his major works after the end of World 
    War I. (2) Must have produced a large body of work, usually in more than one 
    of the basic literary genres--fiction, drama, poetry and the essay. (3) Must 
    have produced at least one book worthy of the epithet &quot;classic.&quot; 
    (4) Must have influenced his successors. (5) Must have shown originality in 
    his use of techniques or presentation of themes. In discussing each of these 
    criteria, I account for why writers such as D. H. Lawrence, Andre Gide, Isaac 
    Babel, Ernest Hemingway, Ignazio Silone, George Orwell and Marcel Proust are 
    omitted. In this introduction I will characterize the works of the twelve 
    in terms of their views of modern life, their technical achievements and their 
    ideological commitments. This introduction, in its final form, should be no 
    more than eight pages in length.</p>
  <p> The task of choosing the most appropriate essays is not complete; tentatively 
    I plan to use the following:<br />
    SAMUEL BECKETT: Martin Esslin, &quot;The Search for the Self,&quot; ~The Theatre 
    of the Absurd~ (Garden City, 1961), pp. 1-46. When edited of nonliterary comments, 
    such as biographical data and the history of the production of his plays, 
    this would be 15,000 words in length.<br />
    BERTOLT BRECHT: Eric Bentley, &quot;Homage to Bertolt Brecht,&quot; introduction 
    to ~Seven Plays by Bertolt Brecht~ (N.Y., 1961), pp. xiii-li. Must be edited 
    of comments on Bentley's personal relations with Brecht and similar remarks 
    to 13,000 words.<br />
    ALBERT CAMUS: Philip Thody, &quot;Achievements and Limitations,&quot; ~Albert 
    Camus: A Study of His Work~ (N.Y., 1959), pp. 94-120, 11,700 wds.<br />

    ~The Modern Poets: A Critical Introduction~ (N.Y., 1960), pp. 75-103, 11,000 
    wds.<br />
    WILLIAM FAULKNER: Robert D. Jacobs, &quot;William Faulkner: The Passion and 
    the Penance,&quot; in ~South: Southern Literature in Its Cultural Setting~ 
    (Garden City, 1961), pp. 142-76, 16,300 wds.<br />
    FRANZ KAFKA: Erich Heller, &quot;The World of Franz Kafka,&quot; ~The Disinherited 
    Mind~ (N.Y., 1959), pp. 199-231, 11,500 wds.<br />
    JAMES JOYCE: Edmund Wilson, &quot;James Joyce,&quot; ~Axel's Castle~ (N.Y., 
    1931), pp., 191-236, 16,500 wds.<br />
    ALBERTO MORAVIA: Sergio Pacifici, &quot;Alberto Moravia,&quot; ~A Guide to 
    Contemporary Italian Literature~ (N.Y., 1962), pp. 29-56, 10,400 wds.<br />
    BORIS PASTERNAK: Edmund Wilson, &quot;Doctor Life and His Guardian Angel,&quot; 
    ~The New Yorker~ (Nov. 18, 1959), pp. 213-38, 9,100 wds. To this I plan to 
    add approximately 2,000 words from Mr. Wilson's second essay, &quot;Legend 
    and Symbol in ~Doctor Zhivago~,&quot; ~The Nation~ (April 25, 1959).<br />
    The other three writers to be featured are THOMAS MANN, JEAN-PAUL SARTRE and 
    NIKOS KAZANTSAKIS. For their works, I have yet to choose a suitable essay.

  <p>~&quot;THE ART OF DEMOLITION: ESSAYS ON AMERICAN WRITING&quot;~</p>
  <p>My thesis is that the literary &quot;hatchet job&quot; is an art. Those essays 
    included in the anthology, fine examples all, should confirm that point. As 
    a secondary purpose, I want to provide readers with a collection of vehemently 
    negative comments on major groups and individuals of American writing. So, 
    in choosing the essays, I observed two principles. First, I wanted effective 
    examples of the art and so included demolitions of minor or forgotten figures 
    only if those essays were artfully done. (See Edgar Allen Poe on Thomas Ward 
    or Alfred Sundel on James Purdy.) Second, I wanted to cover all of American 
    literature, thereby making this collection a counterweight to all the anthologies 
    of laudatory remarks.</p>
  <p> The table of contents would follow an approximate historical order of their 
    subjects. Hence Mark Twain on James Fenimore Cooper is the first essay, while 
    Alfred Sundel on James Purdy is last. Each of them will be prefaced with several 
    lines of terse notes explaining the background and the circumstance of each 
    essay. For example, as a preface to Dwight Macdonald's deflation of James 
    Gould Cozzens, I would need to note the enormous popular and critical success 
    of Cozzens's novel and also write a short biography of the critic. Whenever 
    necessary, the essays themselves should be edited of extraneous materials. 
    The enclosed list of proposed selections includes more than forty essays. 
    As many of my choices are already in the public domain, I would expect the 
    cost of reprint rights to be no more than two thousand dollars.</p>
  <p> Although this anthology is not designed to suit any particular group of 
    purchasers, I suspect it would appeal to readers who, like myself, appreciate 
    the art of demolition and thus have avidly read everything that, say, Dwight 
    Macdonald or Leslie A. Fiedler ever wrote. I also think that students and 
    teachers of American literature should want this volume for its set of contrary 
    opinions on major writers; it could well be included in sophisticated survey 
    courses as an alternate book of criticism. As there is nothing like it, I 
    expect that &quot;The Art of Demolition&quot; could develop a reputation and 
    sell quite well over the years. ~(1963)~</p>

  <p> A few years ago a professor of astronomy at Yale explained to me that his 
    students were superb mathematicians, they had mastered the subject; they would 
    fly to the moon--but they would never be astronomers, because, he said, 'They 
    don't love the stars.' How to produce disinterested and magnanimous people, 
    whether scientists or artists or physicians or statesmen? But I have heard 
    that the Office of Education, or the National Science Foundation in its curriculum 
    improvements, or the Congress when it votes billions for schooling, cares 
    about these things at all.--Paul Goodman, &quot;Wordsworth's Poems&quot; (1969)</p>
  <p>~THE COUNTERTRADITION OF AMERICAN DRAMA: PRELUDE TO THE NEW AMERICAN THEATER~<br />
    This anthology will collect American plays so different from those in the 
    mainstream of our drama that I regard them as constituting a countertradition. 
    The major characteristics of this countertradition are sketched briefly in 
    accompanying notes.</p>
  <p> The book will contain these five plays:</p>
  <p>E. E. Cummings, ~him~ (1927)<br />
    T. S. Eliot, ~Murder in the Cathedral~ (1935)<br />
    Robert Hivnor, ~Too Many Thumbs~ (1947)<br />
    William Carlos Williams, ~Many Loves~ (1942)<br />
    Louis O. Coxe and Robert Chapman, ~Billy Budd~ (1949)</p>
  <p> The firm or person in control of the reprint rights to each of these plays 
    has informed me that, in general, anthology permissions are available. Three 
    of the plays are presently available only in hard-to-procure editions--<br />
    Cummings's, Hivnor's and Williams's; the other two are currently in individual 
    paperback editions. The book will also have an introduction by me of approximately 
    five thousand words which will include an extensive characterization of the 
    countertradition and how its plays differ from those in the main tradition. 
    This introduction will show how such plays presage the New American Theater 
    of the past six years, in addition to offering a brief analysis of each play 
    and its place in the countertradition. Some of this commentary will be drawn 
    from my essay on &quot;The New American Theatre&quot; in ~The New American 
    Arts~ (Horizon, 1964).</p>
  <p> Only in the past few years, since 1958 to be exact, has what I call the 
    countertradition of American drama become the dominant tendency of our theater. 
    As we carefully scutinize the plays of Edward Albee, the playwrights of The 
    Living Theatre (Jack Gelber and Kenneth H. Brown), Arthur L. Kopit and other 
    young writers, we begin to realize that they are, in some essential respects, 
    quite different from the American drama of the past.</p>
  <p> The dominant tradition of our theater, as I see it, embodies two central 
    and often complementary characteristics--realism (as a literary mode) and 
    sentimentality. On one hand, these plays are set in a definite historical 
    time, usually in an identifiable place. The stage intends to evoke a scene 
    factually familiar to us; thus, in the setting there is an emphasis upon accurately 
    reproducing details and in the dialogue the characters reproduce authentic 
    American idiom. This kind of play ususally has a single dominant figure who 
    often earns more of the audience's sympathy than he really merits and, therefore, 
    becomes a vehicle for the play's sentimentality and the playwright's key ideas.</p>
  <p> Whereas the stock popular theater embodies both realism and sentimentality, 
    the better American plays carry, in nearly all cases, only one of these two 
    identifying marks. Playwrights such as Eugene O'Neill and Arthur Miller have 
    been the leading realists, while the works of Tennessee Williams, William 
    Saroyan and Thornton Wilder, all antirealists, are at base sentimental.</p>
  <p> Looking back over the history of our drama, we see that several earlier 
    isolated, eccentric plays resemble the new American theatre in repudiating 
    both characteristics of the dominant theatre. Their setting is usually, as 
    in Beckett's plays, a nowhere--if the playwright specifies one place, it could 
    just as well be another--that symbolizes the world. Rather than directly presenting 
    the facts of reality, plays of the counter-tradition offer interpretations 
    of the world, creating a microcosm that evokes dimensions of existence's feel 
    and tone. Likewise, they are scrupulously unsentimental, embodying a tragic 
    view of human existence (though not, of course, the form of classic tragedy) 
    that we associate with the best modern literature. These authors, eschewing 
    protagonists, create situations in which all the major characters participate 
    equally in defining the scene, just as these writers evoke their themes from 
    the action rather than announce them in the dialogue. Similarly, whereas plays 
    of the dominant tradition express didactic themes, intended to guide our lives, 
    if not to reform our ways, the theater of the countertradition attempts to 
    demonstrate the essences of existence. It is more descriptive than prescriptive. 
    In this respect, ~Billy Budd~ depicts the irreconcilable split between the 
    law of the heart and the heart of the law, Hivnor's ~Too Many Thumbs~ presents 
    the paradox of mankind's evolution, Eliot writes about the conflicting purposes 
    of religion and politics, and Williams describes the necessities and risks 
    of human love.</p>
  <p> This countertradition, then, has much in common with the dominant line of 
    American fiction and poetry which, as recent studies by Leslie A. Fiedler, 
    R. W. B. Lewis and Charles Fiedelson have demonstrated, is more mythic, symbolistic, 
    gothic and metaphysical than social, didactic or realistic. Thus, it is indicative 
    that most of these plays are by authors more noted for their nondramatic works. 
    All the plays I have chosen have received professional productions; all are 
    enthusiastically admired by those who have read or seen them. ~(1964)~</p>
  <p>~A STUDY OF THE PRACTICE OF THEATER IN AMERICA~</p>
  <p>Before discussing the proposed project in detail, I think it appropriate 
    for me to summarize my career as a critic of drama. My academic training at 
    Brown and Columbia Universities was primarily in American literature and history. 
    I did my undergraduate honors thesis on Henry Miller and my graduate work 
    in American intellectual history. However, while a sophomore in college, I 
    saw the Living Theatre's producton of ~The Connection~. Quite excited by it--indeed, 
    it was my first &quot;great experience&quot; in the theater--I wrote an enthusiastic 
    review for the undergraduate newspaper. This piece I later expanded into an 
    article on the play which appeared in ~The Texas Quarterly~ (Winter 1963). 
    On the strength of that article, ~Contact~, a new Bay Area magazine, commissioned 
    me to do a comprehensive essay on the new American playwrights, which it printed 
    in its October 1963 issue. This essay, in turn, led Horizon Press to commission 
    me to edit a book of critical essays by younger critics on new trends in the 
    America arts. For this I revised and expanded the ~Contact~ essay into &quot;The 
    New American Theater.&quot; Since that first review I have developed a wider 
    interest in theater, writing critically on recent playwrights and drama criticism 
    for ~Minnesota Review~, ~Stand~ and other magazines. I came to theater criticism 
    without, in truth, ever having taken a course in modern drama, acted in a 
    play or worked in a theater production. Though I feel I understand recent 
    plays as literature and have used, with some success, the tools of literary 
    analysis to explicate them, I have always felt my theater criticism suffered 
    from my lack of knowledge of the theory and history of performance procedure. 
    I hope to overcome some of these limitations this year in London, in the course 
    of doing a Fulbright project on new trends in British theater and fiction; 
    but since my program is administered through an academic institution and my 
    advisers are literature professors, rather than theater men, I fear that my 
    previous critical leanings will probably be reinforced, rather than tempered.</p>
  <p> My proposed project is to study theatrical practice--styles of acting, techniques 
    of directing, problems of production, methods of financing, varieties of stage 
    design and related problems; and to do this I would like to visit as many 
    significant theaters as possible and to talk with producers, directors, actors, 
    local theater critics and patrons and, most important, to see productions 
    of plays and, ideally, various productions of the same play. In general, I 
    am more interested in companies that produce contemporary work than in those 
    that confine themselves to the classic repertoire. Out of the basic material 
    of a log of observations and conversations, I would like to fashion a long 
    essay or a short book on the practice of theater in America today, to complement 
    my earlier essay on contemporary plays and playwrights. Also, should I discover 
    more new native plays and playwrights worth noticing, I would add an appendix 
    to the earlier essay on &quot;The New American Theater,&quot; or perhaps revise 
    it completely, for the book's possible paperback edition.</p>
  <p> The initial research, as I tentatively plan it, would require four trips. 
    Since I am presently in London and my passage back to America is included 
    in the Fulbright award, it would be foolish not to look first at some major 
    contemporary European theater, primarily to enrich my awarenes of modern theatrical 
    possibilities and to offer me theoretical frameworks and practical standards 
    for understanding and evaluating American theater.</p>
  <p> The European tour would start early in September 1965 with the Edinburgh 
    Festival, where I hope to see both the official and unofficial exhibitions. 
    Then I would travel to Ireland to attend the Dublin Theatre Festival and other 
    Irish theater. From there I would go to Paris, especially to see the work 
    of Roger Planchon (or to Lyon, should he be there instead) and whatever important 
    foreign groups should be visiting Paris; and to Berlin for the Berliner Ensemble 
    and to Opole, Poland, for the heralded, but unknown, theater of Jerzy Grotowski 
    and, perhaps, to Warsaw; then to Prague to look at the theatrical experiments 
    of Josef Swoboda, to Israel for the Habimah and other modernist groups and 
    finally to Milan for the Piccolo Theater of Georgio Strehler. From there I 
    shall return to America (at Fulbright expense, fortunately). I expect to allow 
    at least one week for each city, with two apiece for Edinburgh and Paris--ten 
    weeks in all for the European tour.</p>
  <p> The American portion of the project would involve, tentatively, three extensive 
    trips across the United States between the two theatrical centers, New York 
    and San Francisco. The first would be along the northern route, the second 
    via the South, and the third through the Central states. Certain more important 
    theaters, such as the Arena in Washington and the repertories in San Francisco, 
    I would want to visit more than once. I would expect to spend about one week 
    in each city, studying not only the principal theater but others in the immediate 
    area. At the beginning of each trip, I plan to stay about three weeks in New 
    York City, seeing acting schools, plays, repertories, actors and directors; 
    and at the end of each trip, there will be a week in our second theater city, 
    San Francisco.</p>
  <p> [Each of the next three paragraphs, one for each tour, lists a route of 
    nine theaters between New York City and San Francisco.]</p>
  <p> Should any new theater group spring up in the coming year, such as the projected 
    Los Angeles Civic Repertory, I would, of course, make a special effort to 
    assay its work. In general, I expect to keep an extra eye out for shoe-string, 
    sidetrack, experimental groups which, I suspect, will become more prevalent 
    outside New York in the coming years. In my earlier essay, I noted in New 
    York at least an increasing interest in writing ~important~, rather than commercial, 
    plays and, concomitantly, the rise of a more sophisticated theater audience. 
    Now is the time to discover whether these developments are generally true 
    across the U.S. Finally, I want to ascertain the character of American play 
    production and whether shifts in theatrical presentation accompany changes 
    in the writing of plays. ~(1964)~</p>

  <p> It can be asked if the real history of architecture is not that of schemes 
    which were never built. . . and if there are not, in fact, two architectures, 
    one of research and projects, the other of completed buildings--the second 
    being but a weak echo of the first.--Michel Ragon, &quot;Retrospective de 
    la prospective architecturale,&quot; quoted in Alison Sky &amp; Michelle Stone, 
    ~Unbuilt Architecture~ (1976)</p>
  <p>~AN INVESTIGATION OF THE MAJOR WORKS OF FICTION, DRAMA, POETRY, SOCIAL THOUGHT, 
    ART AND LITERARY CRITICISM, MYTH HISTORY, PHILOSOPHY, ETC., TO DEFINE THE 
    INTELLECTUAL TEMPER OF AMERICA IN THE DECADES FOLLOWING WORLD WAR II~</p>
  <p>As an intellectual history, this is ~not~ an interpretation of an age's artistic 
    character, such as Roger Shattuck's ~The Banquet Years~; it is not a social 
    history of a period, such as Frederick Lewis Allen's two ~Yesterday~ books; 
    it is not a history of ideas, especially as they are embodied in literature, 
    such as ~The Twenties~ by Frederick Hoffman; or an impressionistic picture 
    of the period, such as Thomas Beer's ~The Mauve Decade~; or a thorough survey 
    of many aspects of a culture, such as Robert Graves and Alan Hodge's ~The 
    Long Week-End~. This study will instead emphasize ideas as they are found 
    in literature, only because literature is the most sensitive barometer of 
    intellectual concerns. Hence, a model closer to my conception of this study 
    would be Alfred Kazin's ~On Native Grounds~.</p>
  <p> In discussing intellectuals in different academic specialties, I will necessarily 
    emphasize those who engaged the problems of their age and thus contributed 
    to, or swam with, the intellectual currents of our times. Therefore, the philosopher 
    Walter Kaufmann's ideas will be of more interest than those of the foremost 
    practitioner of linguistic analysis, while the economist John Kenneth Galbraith 
    is of more interest than the author of, say, &quot;Price Stabilization in 
    the Fur Industry.&quot;</p>
  <p> Organizing the materials will, of course, pose the biggest problem. The 
    first temptation is to posit a number of key ideas to characterize the period 
    and then merely group individual thinkers under each heading, as William York 
    Tindall did in his ~Forces in Modern British Literature~. This I find too 
    easy to do in one respect and too disorienting in another. Ideas are attached 
    to thinkers; and although ideas may characterize an age, it is thinkers who 
    make a cultural period. It is more propitious, to my mind, to divide the study 
    into areas of intellectual endeavor, apportioning one chapter to novelists, 
    another to playwrights, another to sociologists, another to psychoanalysts, 
    etc., and then develop the unifying themes through each of those chapters. 
    Here one must choose whether to discuss the field as a whole, or to focus 
    extensively on the work of an eminent but characteristic figure. When Kazin 
    discussed literary criticism, he took the former path, one which I believe 
    is more successful. In contrast, Roger Shattuck saw his era through admittedly 
    second-level figures in visual art, poetry-art criticism, music and drama</p>
  <p> Qualifications: Majored in American Civilization and did extensive work 
    in the history of ideas in European literature. Did independent studies in 
    comparative psychoanalytic theory, the city in American fiction, theories 
    of history and an honors thesis on Henry Miller. Extensive reading in sociology 
    and twentieth century American intellectual history. Have published articles 
    and reviews discussing psychoanalysis, recent European writing, criticism 
    of recent literature, American plays, sociological thinking, cultural criticism, 
    and American fiction in ~Kenyon Review~, ~Commonweal~, ~Contact~, ~Texas Quarterly~ 
    and various other American magazines. ~(1964)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~FULBRIGHT RENEWAL~</p>
  <p>My work so far at King's College [University of London] has focused more 
    around and behind the central subject, contemporary English literature, than 
    directly in it. I was quite familiar with the major post-WWII authors before 
    I came here, as I had selected critical essays on many of them for the book 
    I edited, ~On Contemporary Literature~ (1964). Thus, I felt that, first, it 
    was necessary to gain a more thorough background in twentieth-century English 
    literature and, then, to fathom the current intellectual scene and to learn 
    of contemporary writers whose works, if not their names, were previously unknown 
    to me.</p>
  <p> For the first effort I have been attending at King's College the courses 
    on twentieth-century ficton and drama, as well as doing extensive readings 
    of works not directly touched upon in the courses. I believe I have come to 
    understand what is the British tradition in both these genres and, more important, 
    what works might constitute a countertradition that is still relevant. Second, 
    I have established contact with many of the younger critics who have written 
    extensively on the current scene [named], as well as some of the people about 
    whose work I may be writing. They have provided me with guidance, albeit of 
    various kinds and in even more various directions, in approaching the mass 
    of contemporary materials. Finally, I have done extensive readings in English 
    history--political history, cultural history, literary history--as well as 
    recent social thought and sociology, and I plan to pursue the suggestion made 
    in conversation with our cultural attache', Cleanth Brooks, that the entire 
    Commonwealth of English-speaking people might be regarded as a single literary 
    entity.</p>
  <p> Work projected for the second year would include, first, systematic readings 
    in contemporary literature, especially those writers recommended to me [listed]. 
    When this is finished, I expect to develop my notes on the material into a 
    critical book on recent English literature. My present hypothesis is that 
    in the past decade Britain has witnessed the emergence of a viable, if scarcely 
    known modernist literature. I expect to have several chapters on the various 
    major writers, dealing particularly with their formal inventions and how form 
    is used to convey meaning; several survey chapters on various promising writers, 
    grouped probably by styles; a portrait of the literary scene; some notes on 
    recent developments in critical and social thought; and, in closing, an evaluation 
    of current achievements. Among the writers whose works I plan to discuss in 
    some detail are the novelists William Golding, Doris Lessing, Samuel Beckett, 
    Lawrence Durrell, J. G. Ballard, Derek Ingrey, Christine Brooke-Rose, Philip 
    Toynbee, Nigel Dennis, Wilson Harris, Edgar Mittelholzer, Amos Tutuola, Stefan 
    Themerson, B. S. Johnson; the playwrights N. F. Simpson, David Mercer, Henry 
    Livings, Harold Pinter; the poets Jon Silkin, Peter Redgrove, John Furnival, 
    Ian Hamilton Finlay, Dom Sylvester HouÃ©dard, Ted Hughes and Tom Gunn.</p>
  <p> Other books about this period include John Press's study of the poetry, 
    John Russell Taylor's of the playwriting, James Gindin's (and peripherally 
    Frederick Karl's) of the fiction. I know of no book attempting an inter-genre 
    approach; nor do I know of anyone who is writing such a study. ~(1965)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p> I felt myself to be a radical, not an ideologue; I was proud of the revolutionary 
    yet wholly literary tradition in American writing to which I knew that I belonged.--Alfred 
    Kazin, ~Starting Out in the Thirties~ (1951)</p>
  <p>~PROPOSED PROJECTS FOR A THREE-YEAR FELLOWSHIP~</p>
  <p>The first project is a study of the major trends and figures of American 
    thought in the period from 1945 to 1965. It will include a selective investigation 
    of the work and ideas of the important novelists, poets, playwrights, critics 
    of arts and letters, theologians, interpretative historians, social thinkers, 
    psychologists, philosophers and unclassifiable intellectuals. The proposed 
    study will then attempt to define the common preoccupations, the responses 
    to original problems (e.g., thermonuclear war, automation), the various intellectual 
    tendencies and the historical significance of the era.</p>
  <p> The second project is a study of the American imagination as represented 
    by our greatest creative figures. Tentatively, the research will concentrate 
    upon the works and careers of a novelist (probably Melville), a poet (probably 
    Whitman), a painter (A. P. Ryder), a composer (Ives) and perhaps also a philosopher 
    (Pierce) and an architect (Sullivan), all of whom did their most important 
    work between 1850 and 1920. The project may be supplemented by similar studies 
    of the comparable masters of the period from 1920 to the present (e.g., Faulkner, 
    Cowell or Cage, F. L. Wright, Cummings, Pollock). In addition to exploring 
    the works of various individuals, this project will try to ascertain whether 
    there exist any aesthetic and intellectual characteristics common to these 
    major men and thus peculiar to American cultural excellence. Some of my thoughts 
    on these matters are introduced in the second section of my essay, &quot;Notes 
    on the New American Arts&quot; (1965). ~(1966)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~AN ANTHOLOGY: &quot;ARTISTS IN AMERICA: IN THEIR OWN WORDS&quot;~</p>
  <p>This represents a rough outline, more tentative in detail than conception, 
    of an extensive anthology of the essential statements of America's major painters, 
    sculptors, architects, composers and choreographers, from the beginnings to 
    the present. Most of the selections come from artists who lived in the twentieth 
    century, because only in the last fifty years has America achieved a tradition 
    of sustained, rather than sporadic, excellence in all the arts. My choice 
    of individual spokesmen, as well as the accompanying introduction and headnotes, 
    would emphasize the uniquely eccentric, rather than the conventional and cosmopolitan, 
    in our native traditions. The themes and figures, as well as the principle 
    of gathering the various arts together, relate to books I have already written 
    or projected for the future.</p>

    from the rest of the world, now much that is universally new and incipiently 
    pervasive has its origins here. Differences between indigenous situations 
    (eliminating the race problem, for instance) and those likely to become worldwide 
    (music).<br />
    3. Technology and Affluence. The willful generation of research and development; 
    organization of advanced knowledge. How everyday life has changed, is changing 
    and promises to change in response to technology, and how dependent the average 
    American has become upon commonly available machinery. Statistics and examples.<br />
    4. The interaction of &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;White&quot;: The reality 
    of cultural integration, in spite of social segregation. The &quot;Americanness&quot; 
    of U. S. blacks and the &quot;Negroness&quot; of U.S. whites. Social interest 
    and radical myths. Evolution of U. S. blacks' strategy, between general alternatives 
    of separation and integration, violence and nonviolence. Is there an &quot;Afro-American&quot; 
    culture?<br />
    5. The Cultural Boom. Money and the arts. Foundation and the audiences. Who 
    gets paid and how much? Excesses, dishonesties, monopolies. The commercializa|tion 
    of &quot;radical&quot; culture.<br />
    6. The Popular Arts. Rock music, films, architecture, advertising illustration, 
    studied for themselves and as reflections of social changes and aspirations, 
    etc.<br />
    7. Transformations in the Esoteric Arts. What is new and important in all 
    forms of literature, music, dance, painting, sculpture, film and artistic 
    terrains across and between, in the early seventies.<br />
    8. The Hyper-Educated Society. Increases in numbers educated at all levels. 
    Education as the major U. S. business and political issue. New practices and 
    possibilities in schooling. Effects of hyper-education.<br />
    9. The Politics of Sex. A general view of who does what, how often, and where; 
    and an analysis of what the much-proclaimed &quot;sexual revolution&quot; 
    actually changed.<br />
    10. Politicians and the People. Is Nixon different from Johnson, and how do 
    they both differ from Kennedy. Responses to Vietnam. The issues in cultural 
    modernism. Possibilities of radical, visionary alternatives.<br />
    11. The Forging of an Antagonistic Culture. The generations. The development 
    of hippies, new left, yippies, etc. Symbols and situations of confrontation--<br />
    marijuana, Chicago, Woodstock, etc.<br />
    12. Recapitulation and Prognostication. &quot;Revolution&quot;?</p>
  <p> There will also be bibliographies to each chapter. The aim is to present 
    details and perspectives not commonly known, and yet persuasive. I estimate 
    75,000 words of text, for delivery in 1972-73. ~(1970)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF AMERICAN THOUGHT IN THE POST-WWII PERIOD~</p>
  <p> The concept of &quot;thought&quot; is interpreted as broadly as possible--to 
    include the humanities, the social sciences and the physical sciences; yet 
    the emphasis will be upon intellectual endeavor at the highest cultural levels. 
    The project has grown to four volumes, one of which has already been published, 
    the second of which is currently in production for publication in 1971. The 
    first book, ~Master Minds~ (1969), focuses upon fourteen eminent artists and 
    intellectuals of the first rank, not only to document their individual careers 
    and achievements, but also to define personal and intellectual styles I take 
    to be characteristically contemporary and American. The second volume deals 
    entirely with the nonliterary arts--painting, sculpture, music, dance and 
    filmmaking and the new art forms among and between, such as &quot;environments,&quot; 
    &quot;mixed-means events,&quot; and &quot;artistic machines&quot;; and since 
    my book's major theme is the radical changes implicit in recent work, its 
    tentative title is ~Metamorphosis in the Arts~. The third volume, currently 
    in progress, will complete the consideration of humanistic cultural achievements. 
    Chapters already drafted cover post-WWII social philosophy, sociology, historiography, 
    architecture, government, anthropology, esthetics, literary criticism, and 
    arts criticism. This winter I hope to complete the remaining sections of this 
    volume, tentatively intended to cover economics, jurisprudence, education, 
    philosophy, psychology, city planning, fiction, theater and poetry. While 
    approaching each field of intellectual endeavor as a distinct entity, with 
    its own traditions and preoccupations, my study is continually relating ideas 
    and patterns in one area to those in another, as well as setting contemporary 
    contributions in a larger historical and cultural context. The overall thesis, 
    evident throughout, is that only in the post-WWII period did American culture 
    come of age, developing examples of acknowledged excellence in nearly all 
    fields of intellectual activity. It has, thus, been my aim to define and characterize 
    the important work in each area as judiciously and accurately as possible, 
    particularly in introducing major achievements; but since my aim is an integrated 
    and encompassing picture of genuine excellence, rather than a critique of 
    hypocrises and inadequacies, the book's tentative title is &quot;The Maturity 
    of American Thought.&quot;</p>
  <p> The fourth book, still to be written, will treat intellectual areas less 
    familiar to me. For this reason, I expect to spend next summer, when the hot 
    weather customarily makes reading easier for me than writing, investigating 
    those fields I plan to write about the following winter, ideally completing 
    the four-book project in five years. The folders in my files currently have 
    such titles as physics, chemistry, biology, zoology, computers, management, 
    mathematics, linguistics, cosmology, computers, thermonuclear strategy, electronic 
    communicat|ion; but I expect that further research will establish new topics. 
    The final result of all this research and writing will hopefully be a comprehensive 
    picture of American thinking in recent times. ~(1970)~</p>

  <p>~THE ECCENTRIC TRADITION IN AMERICAN THOUGHT: BEFORE 1850~</p>
  <p>This book will be a series of interrelated profiles of some of the most important 
    minds in American intellectual history prior to 1850. The chapters will not 
    only describe the work of each of the following men but will try to generalize 
    from their example how creative achievement happens in America. The result, 
    I hope, will be an encompassing theory of the American imagination.</p>
  <p>1. Oliver Evans (1755-1819), who devised the first example of assembly-line 
    manufacture<br />
    2. William Billings (1746-1800), a tanner by trade, who was also, by common

    ~A COURSE ON GENIUS IN AMERICA~</p>
  <p>This course will present the work and life of exceptional Americans in a 
    wide variety of &quot;fields,&quot; most, though not all, of them cultural. 
    For various practical reasons, it should begin with contemporary figures and 
    then work backward in history, so that the opening sessions will probably 
    treat individuals already profiled in my book ~Master Minds~ (1969): Ralph 
    Ellison, Allen Ginsberg, Marshall McLuhan and perhaps John Cage. Students 
    will be urged to sample the man's work and/or information about it, as well 
    as some basic biographical data; and classes will discuss the nature of his 
    genius and the possible meanings of his life. Among earlier geniuses I would 
    probably present Jackson Pollock, David Smith, R. Buckminster Fuller, Frank 
    Lloyd Wright, W. E. B. DuBois, Gertrude Stein, Isadora Duncan, Charles Ives, 
    Henry Ford, William Faulkner, D. W. Griffith, Herman Melville, Samuel F. B. 
    Morse, Walt Whitman and Benjamin Franklin. Similarities and contrasts will 
    be continually defined throughout the survey, and students will be asked to 
    do a paper on a similar figure of their choice. Although the course is structured 
    to study interesting individuals, one cohesive theme would be general qualities 
    peculiar to American genius; a second major thread would be the possibilities 
    of American life, for among the ulterior motives of such a course would be 
    the dramatizing of possible models for aspiring students. ~(1972)~</p>

  <p> The various reasons for [architectural] unbuiltness range from positive 
    to negative, albeit the terms positive and negative become ambiguous when 
    one is speaking of the state of being unbuilt (which is here considered to 
    be a &quot;positive&quot; situation). Something built would have lost its 
    magic, and here would be considered to be &quot;negative.&quot;--George R. 
    Collins, introduction to ~Unbuilt America~ (1976)</p>
  <p>~ANALYSIS OF INTELLECTUAL REMUNERATION AND COMMUNICATION IN THE UNITED STATES~</p>
  <p>This proposed project represents an extension of the radical analysis presented 
    in the opening portions of my forthcoming book, &quot;The End of Intelligent 
    Writing,&quot; an elaborate critique of the current channels between intelligent 
    writer and intelligent reader, which has not yet found a publisher, although 
    chapters from it have already appeared prominently in several little magazines. 
    The first half of this study examines the shape of literary politics in America, 
    the development of the most powerful informal group (&quot;The New York Intellectuals&quot;), 
    the forms and functions of literary power, and the current general crisis 
    in the intermediary media--in sum, defining several developments contributing 
    to constriction in the pathways of literary-intellectual communication. This 
    research persuasively documents the existence of distinct blockages, of various 
    kinds and for various reasons, in those channels customarily assumed to be 
    &quot;free,&quot; and I suspect that further research will identify yet more 
    barriers.</p>
  <p> The first part of the proposed extension would investigate intellectual 
    economics, in a general analysis of who gets paid for what and by whom? What 
    kinds of intellectual work are more lucrative, both individually and corporately? 
    And what kinds are not recompensed, and why? Is American intellectual life 
    today subject to any kind of &quot;class&quot; analysis? If so, how do the 
    divisory lines run? This research will necessarily attempt to separate cultural 
    work financed by direct sale and/or royalties from that supported by universities, 
    foundations, and the government, and thus ascertain which cultural enterprises 
    are largely dependent upon subsidy, whether directly (e.g., strategic research) 
    or implicitly (e.g., nearly all &quot;quality&quot; publishing)? How has the 
    structure of U.S. intellectual economics affected the general understandings 
    of literate people? And how has the structure changed in recent decades? How 
    does the American situation differ from European? What are the most glaring 
    inequities? How might the current arrangements be changed? This part requires 
    systematic research and analysis of information that is, by and large, publicly 
    available.</p>
  <p> The second portion of this project will concentrate upon the channels of 
    cultural dissemination, in order to ascertain precisely how intellectual ideas 
    and/or works are presented and then circulated. More specifically, I hope 
    to trace the evolution and dissemination of &quot;successful&quot; innovative 
    ideas, such as Chomskyan linguistics, cybernetic theory, serial musical composition, 
    &quot;revisionist&quot; interpretations of the Cold War, Marshall McLuhan's 
    hypotheses about electronic communication, Herbert Marcuse's critique of industrial-<br />
    bureaucratic society, always noting, in the course of tracing dissemination, 
    what delays and resistances were encountered along the way. I also plan to 
    identify how these researches were subsidized and whether any earlier research 
    in similar veins was neglected and, if so, how these new ideas managed to 
    overcome earlier neglects.</p>
  <p> This study will necessarily deal with the role of private communications 
    (e.g., letters, copies of drafts, etc.) and professional conferences, as well 
    as with the influence of books vs. periodicals at popularizing such ideas. 
    Did the post-literary media help? These questions can be answered through 
    interviews with the participants and their professional associates, and then 
    supplemented by research in libraries and elsewhere. From such investigations 
    would come not only precise histories of intellectual dissemination but also 
    some general descriptions of the<br />
    forces likely to block innovative and/or radical intellectual developments--the 
    kinds of possibly important ideas that are ~not~ becoming general intellectual 
    knowledge.</p>
  <p> Another realm of questioning concerns how cultural businesses profit from 
    first-rank intellectual creation, and how the effort to maximize profit can 
    affect intellectual communication. How has the pattern of profit in cultural 
    enterprises changed in recent years? How has the current crisis in magazine 
    and book publishing affected the situation? In this last respect, I want to 
    pursue further the analysis broached in &quot;The End of Intelligent Writing&quot; 
    by studying more closely the dissemination of &quot;leftist&quot; criticism 
    in the U.S., documenting in yet greater detail the power of the Random House-~New 
    York Review~ combine and the precise character of the several strains of &quot;radicalism&quot; 
    it has historically favored. This last study will also define, for purposes 
    of contrast, the dissemination of other strains of &quot;radical&quot; ideas--leftist 
    criticism from publishers other than Random House, Buckminster Fuller's visionary 
    architectural proposals, the hypothesis of a guaranteed annual income, the 
    formation of &quot;up-from-under&quot; organizations for protest and reform, 
    etc. What ideas are not getting through, and why not? Where does de facto 
    censorship exist? And how does it function? The study will conclude by defining 
    both recent changes in the pattern of intellectual communication and the possibilities 
    of various alternatives. The result should hopefully be a sociology not of 
    knowledge but of the dissemination of knowledge. Both the example and evidence 
    of such &quot;hidden histories&quot; might influence future studies of American 
    thought.</p>
  <p> I would expect to undertake this research in the coming academic year, during 
    which I have no permanent commitments greater than a one-day-per-week college 
    teaching position. Since this project should take at least a year to complete, 
    may I please request support totaling $6,500, which I budget as follows: rent, 
    $2,200; travel, $800; food, clothing, etc., $1,500; typist for final draft, 
    $400; books and magazines, $500; postage and telephone, $600; writing supplies, 
    $300; and miscellaneous, $400. I anticipate incorporating this research into 
    articles suitable for periodical publication and the definitive published 
    version of &quot;The End of Intelligent Writing,&quot; as well as the history 
    of post-WWII American thought on which I have been laboring fitfully for the 
    past few years. I have not applied to any other foundation for aid in this 
    project, whose earlier research was financed entirely by previous free-lancing.

  <p>~A COURSE ON LITERATURE AND THE ARTS TODAY~</p>
  <p>The course would begin by introducing essential distinctions between high 
    art and commercial art, quality and trash (or rare pleasures and common), 
    past art and contemporary, and then proceed to introduce, in the most comprehensible 
    terms possible, some of the most interesting developments in post-WWII, mostly 
    American poetry, fiction, theater, painting, sculpture, film, music, dance, 
    architecture, television and mixed-media arts. The emphasis will be upon differences 
    in the various media--how each has capabilities unavailable to the others. 
    The functions and varieties of &quot;criticism&quot; will also be discussed. 
    These presentations will draw upon my books on ~The New American Arts~ (1965, 
    co-authored) and ~Metamorphosis in the Arts~ (1972-73). I would also expect 
    to invite practitioners, were funds and/or individuals willing, to introduce 
    their work to the class, or the students could visit studios, gallerys, museums, 
    concerts and poetry readings whenever possible. The course's primary purpose 
    is basic literacy in all the arts; secondary themes include interrelations 
    among the arts and conceptions of quality applicable to all arts. Toward the 
    end of the course, students will be asked to submit at least one creative 
    project in any artistic domain, and these will be discussed in class. ~(1972)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~FELLOWSHIP IN ART CRITICISM~</p>
  <p>Research toward a critical and historical study of the influence of avant-garde 
    art upon American literature in the twentieth century. Rather than emphasize 
    the interrelations of prominent individuals, I want to define precisely the 
    major formal revolutions of modernist painting music, dance and film and then 
    identify parallel formal developments in modernist writing. My assumption, 
    which is derived from previous research, is that structural innovations have 
    originated largely in nonliterary arts, for what we call &quot;experimental 
    writing&quot; is generally the result of applying (or adapting) these structural 
    ideas to literary creation. Among these innovations I would already identify 
    collage, cubist perspective, constructivism, serialization, reductionism, 
    intermedia; but I anticipate that further systematic investigation will reveal 
    more subtle developments that will in turn suggest literary parallels. The 
    enclosed essay on &quot;Dada and the Future of Fiction&quot; represents an 
    early foray into such analysis; present research will hopefully be less breathless. 
    I regard this work as preceding a long-projected comprehensive historical 
    and critical study of the emerging &quot;new literature.&quot; ~(1972)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~A COURSE ON ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF LITERATURE~</p>
  <p>The exploration, individually and collectively, of radical ways of creating 
    fiction, poetry and theater. The intention is not to inculcate a particular 
    style but to encourage, if not insist, that participants work in ways previously 
    unknown to them, as either writers and readers. The general aim is strengthening 
    the imagination, both through one's own creative endeavors and in appreciating 
    the innovative works of others. The course will open with the instructor's 
    survey of pattern poetry, words in space, mixed-means theater, fictions without 
    words, &quot;concretism,&quot; and other new forms yet unnamed. Students are 
    expected to submit their own works for scrutiny not only by the instructor 
    but by the class. The emphasis will be upon courage and adventure rather than 
    slickness and familiarity. Enrollment presumes some experience with conventional 
    literary forms and a commitment to the course's purposes. The instructor has 
    written ~The Theatre of Mixed Means~ (1968) and edited ~Imaged Words &amp; 
    Worded Images~ (1970), in addition to contributing his own stylistically radical 
    poems and stories to magazines and anthologies here and abroad. ~(1973)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~ADVANCED WORKSHOP IN EXPERIMENTAL WRITING~</p>
  <p>This would attempt to get students to write in ways other than those they 
    have already developed. Therefore, its first rule would be that you can't 
    do what you're already done. For that reason the workshop would be restricted 
    to advanced students who would be required to submit samples of their work, 
    less to determine their acceptability than to establish their principal style(s). 
    The course will open with a collective effort to define, in formalistic ways, 
    established ways of writing in each genre. With the help of invited guests 
    (and a few of my own anthologies), we would then study the emerging radical 
    alternatives in the nonliterary arts. All this would serve as a background 
    to encouraging students to experiment, ~literally~, with various alternative 
    structures, both known and, hopefully, unknown. The aim is not to make everyone 
    an avant-garde writer, as I suspect that most participants will continue to 
    concentrate upon their previous styles, but to expand not only their arsenal 
    of imaginative techniques but also their awareness of how artistic discoveries 
    can be turned to personal uses. I don't know of any course like this in the 
    U.S., partly because very few people could teach it. Nonetheless, I think 
    it would successfully supplement a writing program based, as most of them 
    are, upon poetry or fiction. I'd prefer teaching in the evening, no more than 
    one night a week; and since the weekly seminar I now conduct numbers thirty-five, 
    a class of two dozen prospective writers does not seem forbidding. Indeed, 
    given this course's emphasis upon artistic variousness, more people would, 
    until a certain number, be more desirable than less. ~(1973)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~AN ANTHOLOGY OF &quot;THE NEW POETRIES IN NORTH AMERICA&quot;~</p>
  <p>Now is the time to do a rigorously avant-garde anthology of North American 
    poetry. In my reading and critical writing over the past few years, I have 
    discovered several radically alternative kinds of poetry; and though works 
    in these veins occasionally appear in survey anthologies or collections of 
    only one kind, no one has ever devoted a book entirely to them. I'm speaking, 
    roughly, of four general categories of new poetry--visual poetry, where the 
    principal means of enhancing language is pictorial; sound poetry, where musical 
    qualities, rather than syntax, are the unifying factor in a poem; minimal 
    poetry, which realizes drastic reductions in the amount of language; and alternatively 
    structured work, which is a looser category of radical poetic options. As 
    these terms suggest, my criterion for newness in art is strictly formalist. 
    My sense of experimental poetry is more elaborately defined in the seventeenth 
    chapter of ~The End of Intelligent Writing~ (1974). Versions of this essay 
    have also appeared in Canadian, British and Australian periodicals. Certain 
    ideas were presented in a television program I wrote and narrated for Camera 
    Three (CBS network). Some of these poets are also included in an exhibition, 
    ~Language &amp; Structure~, that I am presently preparing for an opening in 
    Toronto and subsequent travel around North America. I expect to do more writing 
    and lecturing about this subject.</p>
  <p> The anthology I have in mind would have a categorical organization similar 
    to that of my ~Possibilities of Poetry~ (Delta, 1970), and I regard &quot;The 
    New Poetries&quot; (note plural) as an appropriate sequel to that earlier 
    book. This new collection will, like its predecessor, open with a substantial 
    critical introduction and close with an appendix of bio-bibliographies. It 
    would be unrealistic to provide a specific table of contents at this point, 
    as final selection depends not only upon further research but upon availability 
    and budget. However, among the poets I would expect to include are Vito Acconci, 
    Charles Amirkhanian, Bill Bissett, George Brecht, John Cage, Clark Coolidge, 
    Kenneth Gangemi, John Giorno, Dick Higgins, Jack Kerouac, Robert Lax, Jackson 
    Mac Low, bp Nichol, Norman Henry Pritchard II and Emmett Williams. I would 
    also try to include the appropriate eccentric works of poets with more conventional 
    reputations, such as Thomas Merton and Edmund Wilson. I regard &quot;The New 
    Poetries&quot; as a prelude to another anthology, tenatively entitled &quot;The 
    American Tradition&quot; that would represent a similarly radical reinterpretation 
    of excellence in the history of American poetry.</p>
  <p> One historical precursor for this anthology is Donald Allen's ~The New American 
    Poetry~ (1960), which similarly gathered together kinds of poetry that were 
    neglected at the time (and were often, like current experimental work, dismissed 
    as not poetry). Not only did this Allen anthology change our sense of recent 
    American poetry, but it remains in print fifteen years after its initial publication; 
    I suspect that my book will do as well. The only recent anthology that partially 
    broaches this new terrain is Ronald Gross and George Quasha's ~Open Poetry~ 
    (1973), which is grossly fat, overpriced and underedited. The book I have 
    in mind would, by contrast, run approximately 320 pages. &quot;The New Poetries&quot; 
    would ideally become ~the~ concluding book in survey courses of modern poetry 
    and American literature, and it would appeal hopefully not only to aspiring 
    poets and to poetry readers but also to reviewers and purchasers of my previous 
    anthologies of avant-garde writing. Were this book contracted before the end 
    of 1975, I would expect to deliver it by the fall of 1976. Since I am personally 
    acquainted with most of the book's contributors, I would prefer obtaining 
    the permissions myself. ~(1974)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p> Youth must distinguish carefully between the essential duties and the nonessential, 
    between those which make for the realization of the best common ideas, and 
    those which make merely for the maintenance of a dogma or unchallenged superstition.--Randolph 
    Bourne, &quot;The Dodging of Pressures&quot; (1913)</p>
  <p>~A CRITICAL BOOK ON &quot;CONTEMPORARIES&quot;~</p>
  <p>For several years now, both publishers and fellow writers have been suggesting 
    that I do a comprehensive critical book on the younger generation of American 
    literary writers. I have continuously followed their works, from my earliest 
    days as a book-reviewing critic, and have kept annotated copies of their books. 
    Several of my anthologies have included many works by my chronological contemporaries. 
    Perhaps because my own writing has taken various forms, I have met colleagues 
    in several fields--not just fellow essayists but novelists and poets too; 
    and my memory of these conversations tends to be strong. My book on ~The End 
    of Intelligent Writing~ (1974) includes two chapters on that generation born 
    between 1937 and 1947, which is to say that they graduated from college between 
    1959 and 1968 and will thus be in their thirties in 1977. The fact that visiting 
    European scholars frequently ask me about &quot;the new writers&quot; indicates, 
    I should think, a recognition of my continuing concern.</p>
  <p> Whereas my earlier essays on younger American writers were mostly synoptic, 
    the book I am now proposing, tentatively entitled &quot;Contemporaries,&quot; 
    would focus upon approximately thirty prominent individuals. Organized as 
    a series of personal profiles, averaging 2,500 words in length, this book 
    would describe and analyze their particular literary activities. The essays 
    will be diverse in approach, emphasizing what is important about each person--a 
    single masterpiece, or a developing concern, or a body of significant writing, 
    or literary endeavors other than writing. As these portraits will deal with 
    writers as well as work, I will describe, wherever possible, the people and 
    their lives. Though the tone of the book will be generally sympathetic, I 
    will not resist considered critical judgments. The model in my own previous 
    writing would be the profiles that became ~Master Minds~.</p>
  <p> One good reason for doing this book now is the widespread sense that it 
    ought to be done--that someone ought to organize our critical understanding 
    of a chaotic scene; and if I felt that another critic could do it better, 
    I would gladly step aside. I regard the book as an opportunity to cast my 
    accumulating perceptions and judgments into a definitive form.</p>
  <p> I tentatively expect that &quot;Contemporaries&quot; will include chapters 
    on most of the following individuals, listed alphabetically for convenience.</p>
  <p>Vito Acconci Richard Goldstein Thomas Pynchon<br />
    Renata Adler Dick Higgins Ishmael Reed<br />

  <p>The order of the chapters will hopefully develop an appropriate logic, and 
    I am sure that certain themes will be reitereated at appropriate points throughout 
    the book.</p>
  <p> &quot;Contemporaries&quot; ought to appeal to readers of my other critical 
    books and literary anthologies, especially to those who have been following, 
    so to speak, my earlier writings on this literary generation. More specifically, 
    it should be important to aspiring writers, younger readers, teachers of courses 
    in contemporary literature (in all genres), and many others. Where this book 
    contracted soon, I would probably finish it within eighteen months. ~(1974)~</p>

  <p>Of all the arts, perhaps the most ~mis~treated within television culture 
    is literature. Adaptations, enactments, readings and other methods have attempted 
    to re-create literary works visually, but what is proposed here is a television

    of creating for the medium from scratch.</p>

    staff about extending his ideas into the visual medium. During a one-week 
    residency next fall, the facilities of a fully professional environment will 
    be made available to him to test the limits of sound ~and image~ within the 
    broadcast medium.</p>
  <p> &quot;Among the ideas he is considering: (1) Declaration of Independence: 
    'The making of chroma-keyed footage of me reading the same text at various 
    distances from a single repositioned camera or before cameras at various distances.' 
    (2) Autochronology: 'An autobiographical piece that involves me performing 
    live before a camera in addition to a voice-over narration of me reading a 
    text that will also appear, thanks to a character-generator, on the screen.' 
    (3) 'Reading aloud, in some inventive way, visual poems that appear simultaneously 
    on the screen.'&quot; ~(1977)~</p>

  <p>Further work in experimental fiction. ~(1977)~</p>

  <p>I repeat: It suffices that a book be possible for it to exist. Only the impossible 
    is excluded.--Jorge Luis Borges, &quot;The Library of Babel,&quot; ~Ficciones~ 
    (1956)</p>
  <p>~ARTIST-IN-RESIDENCE, WNET VIDEO LAB~</p>
  <p>Initially a professional prose writer, I began in the late sixties to do 
    various kinds of highly experimental creative work--visual poetry, minimal 
    fiction, visual fiction, nonsyntactic prose--all of which have been widely 
    published, exhibited and anthologized, as well as acknowledged in critical 
    histories of American literature. In the past three years, I have begun to 
    work horizontally, out of printed rectangular pages into other media, such 
    as ladderbooks (4 inches high, several feet long), newsprint books, posters, 
    drawings, silkscreen prints and photolinen. As a guest artist at WXXI-FM in 
    Rochester, New York, March, 1975, I made audiotapes that involved multitracking 
    and inventive microphone placement, among other techniques, to realize initially 
    literary texts in radically different experiential forms. The resulting audiotapes, 
    a unique aural experience, have been broadcast over WXXI-FM itself, the National 
    Public Radio Network, the National Educational Broadcasting Association network, 
    and WBAI-FM (in a two-hour program, devoted entirely to my audioart, which 
    will be rebroadcast on 4 December, 1977, Sunday, 9:30 p.m.). These audiotapes 
    have also been aired at many universities, art museums and comparable &quot;concert&quot; 
    situations. The Intergalactic Poetry Energy Circus, of which I was a principal 
    part, won an award for innovative cultural programming from the Corporation 
    for Public Broadcasting in 1977. In July 1975 and then again in May 1976, 
    I returned to WXXI-FM to make other tapes, and I expect to return there again.</p>
  <p> In September 1975 I was guest artist in video at the Synapse studio of Syracuse 
    University, where I exploited the indigenous possibilities of the video medium 
    to realize in distinctive ways four initially verbal texts. For one story, 
    &quot;Plateaux,&quot; I introduced an evolving moire' pattern; for &quot;Excelsior,&quot; 
    which switches rapidly between two voices (audible on the videotape), I created 
    two abstract kinetic fields, and then swiftly alternated between them. The 
    central work in my initial videotape, ~Three Prose Pieces~ (1975), is &quot;Recyclings,&quot; 
    in which nonsyntactic prose texts are read by several nonsynchronous voices, 
    all of which are mine. The color image consists only of pairs of identical 
    lips (mine), moving synchronously with the audible speech. That is, the first 
    section has one voice and one pair of lips; the last section, devoted to a 
    different text, has six voices and six pairs of lips, which were made by laying 
    one atop the others, through six generations. Thanks to the technique of video 
    superimposition, I was able to make a chorus of myself (and my lips). For 
    ~Openings &amp; Closings~ (1975), a fifty-five-minute tape, I instructed a 
    populous crew to switch rapidly between black-and-white and color images, 
    in response to switches in my own aural declamation, ideally making each new 
    image as radically different as possible from its predecessors. It was my 
    aim to reproduce visually the kinds of leaps in time and space that characterize 
    the printed text of 330 one-sentence stories.</p>
  <p> What I should like now would be another collaborative situation in which 
    I could do alternate versions of these earlier video pieces. I belatedly discovered 
    that &quot;Recyclings&quot; should have been done with two-inch videotape, 
    which would &quot;hold&quot; several generations of overdubbed imagery far 
    better than the one-inch tape we used at Synapse. Second, the imagery of &quot;Plateaux&quot; 
    could be improved, or a wholly different visual experiment tried. Anyone who 
    has collaborated in several audio studios knows that each one offers different 
    inputs, in both technologies and personal tastes, which ultimately influence 
    artistic output; and I think that the same principle is applicable to video 
    studios, in my continuing quest to make definitive realizations of my initially 
    verbal texts. I have been reliably informed that no other video artist is 
    using the medium in this way, and it is commonly known that few published 
    writers have made creative video, as distinct from documentary video. The 
    attached packet contains my much-reprinted essay, &quot;Literary Video,&quot; 
    which includes a general descripton of personal purposes that I take to be 
    artistically unique.</p>
  <p> Beyond that, I would hope as well to bring new, previously unrecorded prose 
    texts to the Video Lab. One of these, &quot;Declaration of Independence,&quot; 
    would involve making my face into a chorus of itself, which would require 
    not only multigenerational passing of imagery (as in &quot;Recyclings&quot;) 
    but also the multiple imagemaker (that I saw in Ed Emshwiller's ~Polobolus~, 
    on your demonstration tape). Another nonsyntactic prose text, &quot;Prunings,&quot; 
    would probably require an extended narrative of kinetic abstract shapes, to 
    complement visually the electronically processed prose declamation.</p>
  <p> For a retrospective exhibition of my creative work in all media, ~Wordsand~, 
    which will open at the Gallery of Simon Fraser University and subsequently 
    tour, I should also like to make a videotape catalogue, so to speak, in which 
    I would introduce the various phases of my creative work; examples of it would 
    be cut into the tape as I talked. (In format and structure, this would resemble 
    the twenty-eight-minute feature program, &quot;Poetry to See &amp; Poetry 
    to Hear,&quot; that I wrote and narrated for Camera Three, CBS network, May 
    1974, a tape of which is presently distributed by the New York State Education 
    Department.) This documentary videotape would then become a keystone in the 
    video component of the exhibition ~Wordsand~, which would include an audiotape 
    catalogue and a conventional spine-bound book-catalogue as well. Like the 
    audiotape and the book, this video ~Wordsand~ would survive the gallery tour 
    to be a documentary in its own right. Given the large amount of visual and 
    verbal material to cut into the basic narrative, I suspect that editing this 
    tape would require computer-assistance. Otherwise, my pieces involve a minimum 
    of props, travel and setting. If there is anyone on camera, it is myself.</p>
  <p> Having also worked with words (visual poetry) and numbers (numerical art), 
    I should like to experiment with your Vidifont character-generator, probably 
    in sequential animation. A machine of this kind was introduced to me at Synapse 
    in 1976, but I was not able to use it during my week there. One advantage 
    of an extended residency at a place convenient to my Manhattan home (unlike 
    Synapse) will be, I assume, sufficient time to discover and consider the unique 
    possibilities that video offers to all strains of my artistic activity. ~(1977)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p> In 1917 Ezra Pound hoped to edit magazines as whole entities--having the 
    kind of complete|ness, formal integrity, structure and continuity or progression 
    you find in a good poem or novel. . . . Since Pound's efforts we have had--as 
    far as I know--only one gut innovation in magazine editing technique. That 
    came in 1970 when Henry Korn and Richard Kostelanetz founded ~Assembling~.--Karl 
    Young, &quot;Assemblings,&quot; ~Margins~ (1975)</p>
  <p>~&quot;GRAND ASSEMBLINGS&quot;~</p>
  <p>Since the two recent ~Assemblings~ are 40% larger than their largest predecessors 
    (and ~Eighth~ had to appear in two volumes), it is clear that we are ~serving~ 
    a large number of writers and artists, mostly American, who would not otherwise 
    be so freely published. In line with the stated intentions of &quot;Development 
    Grants,&quot; we are applying to do three &quot;Grand Assemblings&quot; which 
    will differ from the current versions in that ~we will print and bind~ all 
    camera-ready material submitted by invitees (rather than requiring them to 
    submit a thousand copies of their contribution, appropriately sized). In this 
    respect, the &quot;Grand Assemblings&quot; will resemble the one-shot ~Critical 
    Assembling~, funded by NEA-Literature for 1978 for publication in 1979. For 
    &quot;First Grand Assembling,&quot; we will invite at least four hundred possible 
    contributors to submit no more than two camera-ready pages of anything &quot;otherwise 
    unpublishable&quot; that they want to include. For &quot;Second Grand Assembling,&quot; 
    we will invite at least four hundred possible contributors to submit no more 
    than three sheets into a thousand-page book; and for &quot;Third Grand Assembling,&quot; 
    we would invite five hundred experimentalists to submit no more than four 
    pages. The results would not only be a grand inventory of contemporary literary 
    possibilities, but also be truly incomparable annuals, the best in America 
    since ~New Directions~ of the forties or ~American Caravan~ (1927-36). Copies 
    will go gratis to the contributors, who constitute the initial sophisticated 
    audience; and the remainder will be sold mainly to libraries and collectors. 
    By 1982, &quot;Grand Assemblings&quot; should be economically self-sustaining 
    in some form. We think that &quot;Grand Assemblings&quot; constitute the most 
    propitious way to extend our editorial concept, which Karl Young identified 
    in ~Margins~ as the &quot;only one gut innovation in magazine editing technique&quot; 
    since Ezra Pound's ~Exile~. ~Assembling~ was recently honored with an exhibition 
    at the Pratt Graphics Center in New York City, as perhaps the first U.S. periodical-small 
    press to have an institutional show since ~The Dial~. ~(1978)~</p>

  <p>~ART RETROSPECTIVES ON VIDEOTAPE AND AUDIOTAPE~</p>
  <p>In the autumn of 1978, the Gallery of Simon Fraser University initiated a 
    comprehensive traveling exhibition of Richard Kostelanetz's art with words, 
    numbers and lines, in books, prints, audiotapes, videotapes, film and a hologram. 
    In the preface to the accompanying catalogue, it is suggested that just as 
    the gallery space is an exhibition medium, so can both audiotapes and videotapes 
    be. Since ~Wordsand~, as the exhibition is called, includes both these media, 
    it would be appropriate at this time to do a comprehensive audio presentation 
    about this work and then a videotape exposition as well. In each of these 
    exhibitions, the aim is to bring scattered work together--to show where the 
    art has been, how the different parts relate to one another, and where the 
    art is going. Whereas the gallery remains the incomparable form for exhibiting 
    large prints and drawings, the electronic media should be more effective at 
    presenting such durational arts as audiotapes, videotapes and films. We presently 
    request support to produce entirely on our own initiative, renting equipment 
    and studios as necessary, a one-hour audio ~Wordsand~ and a one-hour video 
    ~Wordsand~; both have already been scripted. The principal precursor for this 
    in Kostelanetz's experience is not his creative video but the program &quot;Poetry 
    to Hear &amp; Poetry to See&quot; which he wrote, organized and narrated for 
    Camera Three-WCBS (1974); a videotape copy of it is enclosed. Both the audio 
    and video ~Wordsand~ will not only be exhibited on his personal tours and 
    in conjunction with later installations of the gallery exhibition, but they 
    will also be offered to public channels that have previously broadcast his 
    work--Soho Artists Video, Synapse, WXXI-FM, WNYC-FM, WBAI-FM, as well as National 
    Public Radio and the Australian Broadcasting Commission. ~(1978)~</p>

  <p>~&quot;AMERICAN WRITING IN 1980&quot;~</p>
  <p>Extending the compositional principle of ~A Critical Assembling~, funded 
    in 1978 by NEA-Literature for publication in 1979, we should like to publish 
    a compendious anthology entitled &quot;American Writing in 1980.&quot; It 
    would be realized in the following innovative way: two thousand U.S. writers, 
    working in a wide variety of modes, would be invited to contribute a single 
    page, 5&quot; by 8&quot;, camera-ready for offset reproduction, in an alphabetically 
    organized book. This invitation would state that the invitee's contribution 
    may consist of literally anything he or she wishes: a fresh manuscript in 
    whole or in part, a page cut from a previously published book, a resume, a 
    manifesto, a list of previous publications, a display that would include both 
    examples and commentary, or anything else that can be reduced to a single 
    5&quot; by 8&quot; mass-<br />
    reproduced format. Every page received from those invited will appear intact. 
    Were this proposal fully funded, invitations would go out in May 1979, with 
    a deadline of 1 October, for book publication at the beginning of 1980: one 
    copy will be mailed gratis to every contributor. The book's principal editor 
    has produced over two dozen anthologies, both selective and inclusive, historical 
    as well as prophetic. As indubitably the most populous anthology of its sort 
    ever published in the U.S., &quot;American Writing in 1980&quot; will ~serve~ 
    more writers than any other and no doubt stand as a monument for our time. 
    Tied to a particular calendar milestone, this proposal will not be made again.

  <p>~FELLOWSHIP FOR MUSIC COMPOSITION~</p>
  <p>Further work in text-sound art, which is my term for language creations whose 
    primary means of both coherence and enhancement are based in sound, rather 
    than syntax or semantics. This work will include the realization of several 
    new tapes of varying complexity and varying duration (including an evening-length 
    &quot;opera&quot; in this mode), as well as the redoing of previous work whose 
    current realizations are technically inferior. Some of this composition will 
    require the expensive rental of a synthesizer and a multitrack audio studio, 
    not only for the creation but for subsequent postproduction (e.g., mixing 
    down into quadriphonic and stereo tapes suitable for concert performance and 
    radio broadcast). Further text-sound work with videotape is also a possibility.</p>
  <p>*</p>
  <p> Thanks for your request for a &quot;more detailed description of the work 
    proposed.&quot; One hesitates to give away too many professional secrets to 
    a jury of peers, especially prior to realization, let alone dissemination; 
    but here are a few compositions I would like to do:</p>
  <p>(1) A more sophisticated ~Praying to the Lord~, whose initial version was 
    produced on primitive machinery at the Western Front in Vancouver, BC, a year 
    ago. Make two basic tapes, one of the Lord's Prayer in English and the second 
    of a comparable Hebrew prayer. Then quadri-canonize each of these modules 
    through five generations, so that four voices in staggered succession appear 
    on the second generation tape, and then sixteen voices on the third generation, 
    up to 256 on the fifth generation. Should I have access to supersophisticated 
    equipment (i.e., a two-inch tape recorder with sixteen or more tracks), I 
    should consider a sixth generation. More professional machinery would enable 
    me to eliminate the noise and hiss that plague my current tape, which has 
    nonetheless been aired over public radio here.</p>
  <p>(2) &quot;Counting,&quot; in which I count to one hundred, using one voice 
    for the number &quot;one,&quot; two variations of my own voice for the number 
    two, up to one hundred voices of me, each preferably different in quality, 
    for the number one hundred. This should be spectrumized; and given the number 
    of voices I want to process, obviously the more audiotracks that are available 
    the better the results will be.</p>
  <p>(3) A series of pieces involving tapedelay of nonsyntactic language, so that 
    related words are heard simultaneously in varying arrangements.</p>
  <p>(4) Further experiments along the line of &quot;Recyclings,&quot; which require 
    that the spectator hear (and distinguish) several words simultaneously, much 
    as a musical chord incorporates several notes simultaneously.</p>
  <p>(5) My plans for an evening-length &quot;opera&quot; I would rather keep 
    to myself, but suffice it to say that I would function as both &quot;the composer&quot; 
    and &quot;the librettist&quot; for this work. Okay, let me just hint that 
    it will deal with the rhyming properties of language.</p>
  <p> Even though this work is based upon language, it is ~music~ in that it uses 
    structures and machinery more typical of music than &quot;literature.&quot; 
    That accounts for why the primary means of both coherence and enhancement 
    are, as I noted in my original application, sound, rather than syntax or semantics.</p>
  <p> At the suggestion of a member of your staff, I also enclose a videotape 
    of mine, realized two years ago at the Synapse studio of Syracuse University. 
    The third piece on the tape, roughly six minutes down, incorporates a musical 
    piece into an audiovisual experience. (The overdubbed imagery is my lips.) 
    The first two pieces on the videotape I would classify as closer to &quot;literature&quot; 
    than ~music~. Let me suggest that categories are useful in classifying work, 
    not people, especially at a time when the most adventurous artists want to 
    work in more than one area, at once importing ideas from other arts and yet 
    respecting the particular possibilities of the art at hand, which is in this 
    case ~music~. ~(1978)~</p>

    Yes, but they failed. They were published as books.--Richard Burgin, ~Conversations

  <p>~AN ASSEMBLING OF &quot;AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY IN 1980&quot;~</p>
  <p>Following the innovative book-compositional principles of ~Assembling~, we 
    will invite four hundred notable American photographers to submit one 8&quot; 
    x 10&quot; photograph apiece for inclusion in an alphabetically organized 
    book. All photographs submitted by those invited will be included in &quot;American 
    Photography in 1980,&quot; which will thus become the most open and comprehensive 
    inventory of the art in the U.S. today: 368 pages, 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot;, 
    300-line screened halftones, 70-lb. coated stock, 2,000 copies. One copy will 
    go gratis to every contributor. ~(1978)~</p>

  <p>~FELLOWSHIP IN ART CRITICISM~</p>
  <p>May I propose an extended critical essay on ~polyartists~, which is my coinage 
    (acknowledged by Merriam Websters) for individuals who do distinguished work 
    in two or more unadjacent media. (Sculpture and painting are as adjacent as 
    poetry and fiction, or video and film, while painting and film, say, are not 
    adjacent. A polyartist should not be confused with a ~dilettante~, whose work 
    in several areas is undistinguished.) After describing the polyartistic imagination 
    in general, I hope to deal with specific figures, defining qualities common 
    to a particular polyartist's work in two or more domains and/or identifying 
    those fundamental esthetic ideas that appear in various arts. My hypothesis 
    is that the polyartist should be considered a radically different kind of 
    artist. The essay's introduction will then survey the total work of such great 
    modern polyartists as Marcel Duchamp, Kurt Schwitters, L. Moholy-Nagy, El 
    Lissitzky, Hans Richter, Hans (Jean) Arp, Jean Cocteau and Wyndham Lewis.</p>
  <p> Most of the essay will be devoted to discussing in critical detail those 
    contemporaries, mostly American, who extend this tradition: John Cage, R. 
    Buckminster Fuller, Claes Oldenburg, Dan Graham, Sol LeWitt, Michael Snow, 
    Yvonne Rainer, Vito Acconci, Tom Phillips, Andy Warhol, Alison Knowles, Leonora 
    Carrington, Robert Morris, and Dick Higgins, among others. I expect that this 
    essay, once completed, will appear in a periodical and perhaps be incorporated 
    into an illustrated book. ~(1978)~ </p>

  <p> The shift from object to concept denotes disdain for the notion of commodities--the 
    sacred cow of this culture. Conceptual artists produce a professional commitment, 
    that restores art to artists, rather than to &quot;money vendors.&quot; The 
    withdrawal of art into itself may be its saving grace. In the same sense that 
    science is for scientists, and philosophy is for philosophers, art is for 
    artists.--<br />
    Ursula Meyer, ~Conceptual Art~ (1972)</p>
  <p>~THE UPDATING, REVISION AND PUBLICATION OF &quot;TEXT-SOUND ART IN NORTH 
    AMERICA&quot;~</p>
  <p>A fifty-page essay was initially written in 1976, after years of informal 
    research, under a modest NEA Visual Arts Services Grant. Text-sound art is 
    my definition for the intermedium between language and music, where words 
    are enhanced primarily in terms of sound, rather than syntax or semantics. 
    Text-<br />
    sound art has been performed live in concerts, broadcast over media, and recorded 
    on tapes and records. This essay was, to my knowledge, the first comprehensive 
    survey of North American text-sound artists ever published; at minimum, it 
    makes everyone aware of American exemplars of an art that has received far 
    more attention in Europe. An abridgment of this essay appeared in ~Performing 
    Arts Journal~ II/2-3 (Fall 1977; Winter 1978); a more severe abridgment appeared 
    in the ~New York Times~ (24 July 1977). People continually ask for copies. 
    In an appendix to the NEA report, I proposed an anthology of printed materials 
    relevant to the art, &quot;Text-Sound Texts.&quot; The production of camera-ready 
    copy for this book was funded by NEA Visual Arts Services in 1978.</p>
  <p> What I should like to do now, with requested support, is update the previous 
    essay, revising and enlarging it to utilize newer knowledge about and experience 
    of text-sound art (traveling if necessary to secure it). The definitive essay, 
    &quot;Text-Sound Art in North America,&quot; I would then published in a paperback 
    edition of two thousand copies that would probably be 5&quot; x 8&quot; in 
    size, ninety-six pages in length, and inexpensive in price. As an experienced 
    smallpressman, I would handle all aspects of book production myself, and copies 
    of the book would be consigned to the major small-press distributors. In the 
    past two years, I have proposed this book to several commercial publishers, 
    university presses, and even noncommercial publishers, yet all for their own 
    reasons were unable to contract it. Nonetheless, an audience for this book 
    exists, initially among practitioners, who have no other source for comprehensive 
    knowledge of what other North Americans are doing, and then among the producers 
    of radio and other audio programs who would like to air a language art--a 
    &quot;poetry,&quot; if you will--that is particularly appropriate to both 
    their medium and our times. ~(1979)~</p>

  <p>~PERIODICAL PUBLICATIONS OF &quot;EPIPHANIES&quot;~</p>
  <p>~Epiphanies~ is a large collection of single-sentence fictions that have 
    no necessary relation to one another. These are offered to literary editors 
    to excerpt to their tastes. The idea is that editors are invited to extract 
    from the entire text the individual sentences they wish to publish--it is, 
    after all, the forte of ~editors~ to select. These sentences may then be published 
    in any order, as long as the published arrangement clarifies that the sentences 
    were not otherwise connected to one another--say, with extra space between 
    them, or separate paragraphs, or blocks of type afloat in the space of the 
    page. Publishers should consider this an opportunity for innovative design 
    and typesetting--for doing something different not only from what they usually 
    do but from what others have done. The sentences in ~Epiphanies~ will also 
    become the material of an audiotape, a film, a videotape, and perhaps a book, 
    as well as a gallery installation in which all printed versions will also 
    be exhibited, with acknowledgment to their respective editors. ~(1979)~</p>

  <p>I've written. . . a poem about a friend who promised us a picture. He died. 
    He's a well-known Argentine painter, Larco, and then I thought of the picture 
    he had promised us, promised my wife and me--I met him in the street--and 
    then I thought that in a sense he had given us a picture because he had intended 
    to do so, and so the picture was in some mystic way or other with us, except 
    that the picture was perhaps a richer picture because it was a picture that 
    kept growing and changing with time and we could imagine it in many different 
    ways, and then in the end I thanked him for that unceasing, shifting picture, 
    saying that, of course, he wouldn't find any place on the four walls of a 
    room, but still he'd be there with us.--Jorge Luis Borges, in conversation

  <p>~AN ASSEMBLING OF &quot;AMERICAN ART IN 1980&quot;~</p>
  <p>Extending the book-compositional principles of ~Assembling~, an annual compilation 
    that I have coproduced since 1970, I should like to publish a compendious 
    anthology entitled &quot;American Art in 1980.&quot; It would be realized 
    in the following innovative way: Eight hundred upper-rank U.S. visual artists, 
    working in a wide variety of modes, would be invited to contribute one page 
    apiece, 8&quot; x 10&quot;, camera-ready for offset reproduction in an alphabetically 
    organized book. The invitation would state that this contribution may consist 
    of literally anything that artist wishes: a black-and-white (Veloxed) reproduction 
    of self-selected work, a manifesto, an original drawing, a resume, a compressed 
    catalogue, a proposal, a display that would include both examples and commentary, 
    or any other possibility that fits into a single 8&quot; x 10&quot; mass-reproduced 
    format. Every page received from those invited will appear intact. Were this 
    proposal fully funded, invitations would go out in the summer of 1979 with 
    a deadline of 1 October, 1979, for book publication at the beginning of 1980. 
    When the grant is securely in hand, other funding sources will be canvased 
    for support sufficient to enlarge the number of pages (and thus the number 
    of invited contributors). As indubitably the most comprehensive anthology 
    of its sort ever published in the U.S., this will no doubt stand as a monument 
    for our time. Drawing upon my experience in organizing and producing such 
    compilations, I would expect to publish the book in an edition of two thousand 
    copies, 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot;, 70-paper, perfect-bound and individually shrink-wrapped; 
    one copy will be mailed gratis to every contributor. Costs of printing and 
    postage can be expected to run at least $8,000. The remaining copies would 
    be distributed by Jaap Reitman, Printed Matter and other specialists in contemporary 
    art books. If contributors tell their friends and colleagues about the book. 
    the other copies will quickly be gone. It is hoped that everyone professionally 
    interested in the subject will want to have &quot;American Art in 1980.&quot;

  <p>~A FILM OF &quot;CONSTRUCTIVIST FICTIONS&quot;~</p>
  <p>The production by Richard Kostelanetz and Peter Longauer, collaborating as 
    equals, of a ninety-minute, three-part film of Constructivist Fictions is 
    to be a collection of unrelated episodes (expanding the demonstration film), 
    a single sustained narrative (&quot;Symmetries&quot;), and a single narrative 
    with overlapping sequential parts (&quot;Intermix&quot;).</p>
  <p> Constructivist Fictions are line drawings that change in systemic sequence. 
    The systems informing these changes may be additive, reductive, permutational, 
    or combinational, among other syntactic techniques. One recurrent theme is 
    variation and development within a systemic constraint. In film, unlike graphic 
    media, the rate of progression can be manipulated, so that the transitions 
    occur at precisely determined speeds that can, for example, be constantly 
    slow, medium or fast, or progressively accelerating or decelerating. Film 
    enables us to control not only the sequential ordering of the individual images 
    but the time allowed for their perception as well. Such cinematic devices 
    as fades and dissolves, when judiciously employed, serve the ends of Constructivist 
    Fictions and become elements of it, widening the potentialities of the work 
    itself and further enhancing the esthetic experience. Although the filming 
    of Constructivist Fictions depends upon animation techniques, the result is 
    not animation in the usual sense. Rather, filmed Constructivist Fictions become, 
    we feel, visual poetry of a precise mathematical order comparable to music 
    and could indeed be defined as a visual approximation of music. Both artists 
    have shown their work widely, Kostelanetz at universities and art museums, 
    Longauer on both public and commercial television. ~(1979)~</p>

  <p>~A FESTIVAL OF AMERICAN SOUND POETRY~</p>
  <p>~Text-Sound Texts~ is the title of an anthology that Richard Kostelanetz 
    produced under a 1978 grant from NEA-Visual Arts Services. This fall, its 
    four-hundred-plus camera-ready pages will be delivered to William Morrow, 
    Inc., which has contracted to publish both hardback and paperback editions 
    in the spring of 1980. Since this collection is the first of its kind exclusively 
    of North American work, several of us sound poets would like to organize in 
    the wake of its publication the First American Sound Poetry Festival, surely 
    in New York (at a major local museum), probably with satellite festivals elsewhere 
    in the U.S. (e.g., San Francisco and Ann Arbor). At these festivals, contributors 
    to the book would present their text-sound works, on the average of three 
    per evening for twenty sessions. Although European countries have frequently 
    presented comprehensive sound-poetry festivals, it is unfortunate, as well 
    as indicative, that none has yet happened in the U.S. These performances should 
    also be professionally recorded for subsequent radio broadcast. Contributors 
    to the book are listed, along with their works, on an enclosed table of contents. 
    Some of these people are better known as &quot;composers&quot; or &quot;painters&quot;; 
    nonetheless, all of them create language works that are best defined as &quot;sound 
    poetry.&quot; This application requests support for honoraria, travel reimbursements, 
    organizing costs and recording expenses for at least sixty participating poets. 
    This First American Sound Poetry Festival should be regarded as a prelude 
    to the Fifteenth International Festival--the first to take place in the U.S.--hopefully 
    in 1982. ~(1979)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p> In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the 
    work. When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the 
    planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory 
    affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art. This kind of art is 
    not theoretical or illustrative of theories; it is intuitive, it is involved 
    with all types of mental processes and it is purposeless. It is usually free 
    from the dependence on the skill of the artist as a craftsman.--Sol LeWitt, 
    &quot;Paragraphs on Con|ceptual Art&quot; (1967)</p>
  <p>~THE PREPARATION OF A SERIES OF &quot;AUTOBIOGRAPHIES&quot;~</p>
  <p>in a wide variety of forms and media, including a book or, more likely, books; 
    poster-maps; essays of diverse lengths; an audiotape; a videotape; and perhaps 
    a film and hologram. All of these are genres and media in which I have previously 
    worked. Composing a self-portrait from many perspectives in time and space, 
    including dimensions omitted from most earlier autobiographies (e.g., the 
    actual sound of a subject's voice), I hope to allow the reader-<br />
    spectator a greater opportunity to interpret a wealth of data--not only the 
    biographical facts, but also the ways in which these facts are presented. 
    My experimental hypothesis is that the truest autobiography of a many-sided 
    person would necessarily be even more various in its approaches. An abundance 
    of Autobiographies could perhaps realize a complexity of self-understanding 
    and self-presentation that would be less likely, if not impossible, in a more 
    conventional narrative. As a trained historian, I am less interested in myself 
    per se than in the exploration of biographical structures, which is to say 
    the various ways in which a complex life can be understood. In part for convenience, 
    the life I choose is my own. ~(1979)~</p>

  <p>~AN ANTHOLOGY OF &quot;THE OTHER POETRIES OF NEW YORK CITY&quot;~</p>
  <p>Since the spring of 1979, Charles Doria and I have been collecting poetry 
    written in New York City in ~languages other than English~. We are requesting 
    funds to prepare a special issue of ~Assembling~ of these poems, reprinting 
    camera-ready offset the original texts (and typesetting previously unpublished 
    poems), ~en face~ from translations, detailed glosses or other explanatory 
    material that Dr. Doria will prepare in collaboration with the authors and 
    sympathetic translators. It can be expected that this proposed project will 
    include poems initially written in French (including Creole), Spanish, Hebrew, 
    Yiddish, Ukranian, Polish, Chinese, Russian, Greek and Lithuanian, among other 
    languages. Announcements of this project will appear in the literary press 
    at the end of 1979, and we expect that practitioners will advise one another 
    to submit their exemplary works. Dr. Doria is personally proficient in Greek, 
    Latin, Coptic, French, Italian, French and German, and he has translated from 
    most of these languages. We expect that this ~Assembling~ of &quot;The Other 
    Poetries of New York City&quot; will run at least four hundred pages and be 
    printed in a perfect-bound edition of at least two thousand copies. There 
    should be extensive publicity in the New York City ethnic press and distribution 
    to ethnic bookstores, as nothing like this anthology has ever appeared in 
    New York (or the U.S.) before. ~(1979)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~&quot;WORDWORKS: POEMS SELECTED &amp; NEW&quot;~</p>
  <p>This will be Richard Kostelanetz's sixth book of poetry. Within its ninety-six 
    pages will be the best and most anthologized poems from his earlier collection: 
    &quot;Disintegration,&quot; &quot;Live-Die,&quot; &quot;Concentric,&quot; 
    and &quot;Nymphomania,&quot; among others. It will also contain illustrations 
    of his recent poetry hologram.</p>
  <p> The intent is to cull a volume that is better than any of his previous individual 
    books: ~Visual Language~ (1970), ~I Articulations~ (1974), ~Rain Rains Rain~ 
    (1975), ~Portraits from Memory~ (1975), ~Illuminations~ (1977).</p>
  <p> &quot;Wordworks&quot; would benefit from appearing in the wake of Kostelanetz's 
    collected essays on poetry, ~The Old Poetries and the New~ (1981), in the 
    University of Michigan Press's distinguished series, &quot;Poets on Poetry.&quot;</p>
  <p> His poems have been published and exhibited around the world, and they have 
    also been included in over thirty-five anthologies. In recent histories of 
    American literature (e.g., ~Literary History of the United States~, ~The Harvard 
    Guide to Contemporary American Writing~), he is commonly acknowledged as one 
    of America's major experimental poets.</p>
  <p> Since little in the book requires fresh typesetting, the manuscript is nearly 
    entirely camera-ready, and a photocopy of it can be submitted to book publishers 
    promising a quick reply. ~(1980)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~AN AUDIOAUTOBIOGRAPHY~</p>
  <p>My principal multimedia project at present is the production of a series 
    of ~Autobiographies~. My experimental hypothesis is this: since it is the 
    nature of the autobiographer to leave out more than he puts in, the truest 
    autobiography would be various in its approaches, each element ideally containing 
    something that the others lack. The &quot;Audioautobiography&quot; will draw 
    upon recordings of my voice, the voices of my family and friends, recordings 
    of passages from books that have influenced me, and historic audio materials, 
    reproducing not only sounds from my life but, literally, the sound of me, 
    which are two dimensions that previous autobiographers, dealing only with 
    the medium of print, were unable to include. Examples of extrinsic excerpts 
    include FDR announcing the end of WWII, Ralph Ellison reading the opening 
    of ~Invisible Man~ (for which both tape and permission have already been obtained), 
    All-State Choir in 1956, memoirs of friends, family and colleagues. Parts 
    of the composition will depend upon multitracking, as the narrator in the 
    present speaks over sounds from the past; and the whole must be edited with 
    the highest precision. I expect to produce it out of my own studio and multitrack 
    studios rented in New York City.</p>
  <p> As a sometime historian (listed in the 1968 and 1973 editions of the ~Directory 
    of American Scholars--Historians~), I am less interested in myself per se 
    than in the exploration of a diversity of autohistoriographical structures, 
    which is to say the various ways in which one's life can be understood. In 
    part for convenience, the life I choose is my own--its facts are more familiar 
    to me, and about it I am less likely to be inconsistent.</p>
  <p> I know of no audiotape like it. There have been autobiographies in print, 
    to be sure, but no audioautobiography known to me; and in this sense, mine 
    might become a model for what others might do, not only for broadcast but 
    for private purposes. ~(1980)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~A BOOK OF &quot;PREAMBLES&quot;~</p>
  <p>&quot;Preambles&quot; is a tentative title for a proposed book that would 
    collect Richard Kostelanetz's introductory essays written for the following 
    collections of literature, art, criticism and social thought: On Contemporary 
    Literature (1964, 1969), The New American Arts (1965), Twelve from the Sixties 
    (1967), Beyond Left &amp; Right (1968), Possibilities of Poetry (1970), Imaged 
    Words &amp; Worded Images (1970), Social Speculations (1971), Seeing Through 
    Shuck (1972), In Youth (1972), The Edge of Adaptation (1973), Breakthrough 
    Fictioneers (1973), Short Fictions (1974), I Articulations (1974), Essaying 
    Essays (1975), Younger Critics in North America (1976), A Critical Assembling 
    (1979) and Autobiographies (1981). Nothing included here appears in either 
    the author's ~Twenties in the Sixties~ (1979) or his ~Wordsand~ (1978), both 
    of which collect essays of his that had not previously appeared in books published 
    under his name.</p>
  <p> As many of these collections are presently out of print, &quot;Preambles&quot; 
    would be the only place in which these essays could be conveniently found. 
    Several are regarded among the best of kind; most were pre-published in magazines; 
    some have already been reprinted in anthologies edited by others. Kostelanetz's 
    essays could be offset directly from their original publications, or be entirely 
    reset and perhaps revised for this new book. Each should be prefaced with 
    a brief headnote, recalling the occasion for which it was written and perhaps 
    describing the book it introduced; and &quot;Preambles&quot; will open with 
    an introduction to the problems of introductions. The only book comparable 
    to this is W. H. Auden's ~Forewords &amp; Afterwords~ (1973), which actually 
    contains, its title notwithstanding, more book reviews than essays initially 
    written to introduce books. It is expected that readers interested in contemporary 
    art, literature, criticism and social thought will continue to consult these 
    essays and, thus, want to obtain &quot;Preambles.&quot; Since nearly two hundred 
    thousand copies of these earlier collections have already been sold, it can 
    be assumed that many readers are familiar with the author's name and his work. 
    ~(1980)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~VIDIFONT WRITING~</p>
  <p>In 1979, I began to work with the video character-generator, the electronic 
    letter-making machine, initially for ~Declaration of Independence~ and then 
    with ~Epiphanies~. The latter is based upon over twenty-five hundred single-sentence 
    stories, which were initially written on 3&quot; x 5&quot; cards, in unfixed 
    order, for publication in several possible forms: in a book, as a gallery 
    exhibition on cards, on an audiotape, for a film and/or a videotape. The proprietor 
    of a private New York studio, Davidson Gigliotti, invited me to use his character-generator, 
    which is limited to a single style of type and a grid ten lines high and twenty-eight 
    characters wide, to throw the stories individually on the screen in various 
    typographic arrays.</p>
  <p> Obviously, it would be more advantageous to compose further video Epiphanies 
    on the Vidifont Mark II that, I understand, has multiple type styles, proportional 
    spacing, typefaces of various sizes and a voluminous memory. Because I would 
    want each story to look as different as possible from all the others, I would 
    expect to exploit the total capabilities of this technology. (According to 
    its caretakers, this has scarcely been done before.) Whether these Epiphanies 
    require background imagery remains to be known. (I think not; but if so, I 
    would, true to my constructivist tastes, use nothing more complicated than 
    different individual colors or regular patterns as edge-to-<br />
    edge background. I have no intention of ever shooting outside the production 
    studio.) As audio background, I will probably continue to use Samuel Feinberg's 
    spectacular recording of J. S. Bach's ~Well-Tempered Clavier~. The result 
    would be several thirty-minute programs (or perhaps thirty seven-minute programs, 
    or both) ideally for serial distribution over National Educational Television. 
  </p>
  <p> Several other prose pieces of mine suggest possibilities for the character-generator. 
    &quot;Stringtwo&quot; is a seventy-foot typewritten word, composed as it is 
    of overlapping English words, and it would be interesting to run this as a 
    continuous horizontal crawl, probably in conjunction with an audiotaped reading 
    of the same text. &quot;Partitions&quot; is a work initially composed for 
    the eight-page memory of the limited character-generator mentioned before. 
    Here the six words within a single word would become successively visible 
    before the entire word appears again (e.g., partitions/pa/par/part/art/tit/it/|partitions). 
    One hundred and ten different words, enhanced in these ways, would appear 
    on the screen in a rigorous incremental presentation that moves progressively 
    from one at a time (twice) up to ten at a time (also twice), the visual-verbal 
    perception thus becoming progressively more difficult. Experience with successful 
    residencies also tells me that this work with the Vidifont Mark II is likely 
    to inspire new writing that is created especially for the machine's particular 
    capabilities. Naturally, work on these secondary pieces depends upon available 
    budget and time.</p>
  <p> Because I have never used this sophisticated character-generator before 
    and have never before employed a typesetting technician, I have no credible 
    idea of how much these works would cost to produce or even how long they would 
    take to make. Your administrator cites the rates of twenty dollars per hour 
    for the Vidifont and thirty-five dollars per hour for the required operator. 
    Since the typesetting of twenty-five hundred separate stories, each ideally 
    with its own typography, is alone likely to take 160 hours (at four minutes 
    apiece), it seems appropriate to budget at least 200 hours here. Since that 
    will cost ten thousand six hundred dollars (@ fifty-five dollars per hour), 
    it seems to me that fifteen thousand dollars would be a reasonable total; 
    the remaining funds will go to pay for videotape, dubbing copies, re-editing, 
    transportation, assistance and contingency fees.</p>
  <p> My work with video has so far focused upon its possibilities as a ~literary~ 
    medium, discovering how it can enhance language, rather than deflect it, and 
    what kinds of language can best exploit the unique capabilities of the medium. 
    It is unfortunate, I think, that public television in America has presented 
    remarkably little original contemporary literature, preferring instead to 
    produce interviews with prominent writers and adaptations of familiar short 
    stories. The contrary examples of European public media show that this absence 
    need not be. ~(1980)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p> An interesting thing to start with would be the whole notion of the object, 
    which I consider to be a mental problem rather than a physical reality. An 
    object to me is the product of a thought; it doesn't necessarily signify the 
    existence of art. My view of art springs from a dialectical position that 
    deals with whether something exists or doesn't exist. I'm more interested 
    in the terrain dictating the condition of art.--Robert Smithson, quoted in 
    Lucy R. Lippard, ~Six Years~ (1973)</p>
  <p>~A CRITICAL HISTORY OF RECENT INNOVATIVE LITERATURE~</p>
  <p>I have observed, in ~The End of Intelligent Writing~ (1974, 1977) and elsewhere, 
    that literary experimentation continues in America, even if such work is rarely 
    acknowledged in the prominent reviewing periodicals. What I am presently proposing 
    is an extended examination that is both historical and critical of significant 
    formal innovation in recent American literature. My historical assumption 
    is that certain literary styles that were prominent in the sixties--for instance, 
    expressionist confessional poetry, collage and pastiche, ironic narration, 
    etc.--have by now all become milestones that an authentic avant-garde must 
    decisively surpass. With this distinction in mind, I have identified currently 
    innovative forms in poetry, fiction, drama and the essay. This literature 
    was sketchily surveyed in the penultimate chapters of ~The End of Intelligent 
    Writing~; some of it has been anthologized by me in several books and included 
    in the traveling exhibition I curated, ~Language &amp; Structure in North 
    America~ (1975-77). Generalizations about this work were presented in &quot;An 
    ABC of Contemporary Reading,&quot; which I included in ~Esthetics Contemporary~ 
    (1978) and which I recently worked into a longer manuscript that will appear 
    in a special issue of ~Poetics Today~ devoted to &quot;The Poetics of the 
    New Literature.&quot;</p>
  <p> What I am presently requesting is a full year's support to write a book-<br />
    length critical survey of this recent writing, discussing major writers and 
    works in depth and detail. In the section on poetry, for instance, I would 
    expect to discuss not only visual poetry and sound poetry--the intermedial 
    forms of poetry--but also minimal poetry, abstract poetry, asyntactical poetry, 
    among other currently radical forms. In my chapters on fiction, I likewise 
    expect to separate those innovative works that purify the elements indigenous 
    to fiction from those that mix them with materials, ideas and structures more 
    typical of the other arts. I expect, in addition, to do comparable chapters 
    on innovative dramatic writing and on innovative literary exposition. I include 
    Canadians because, for reasons explained elsewhere, I consider English-language 
    Canadian writers to be a neglected minority within North American literature.</p>
  <p> Since this avant-garde American literature has not received much criticism 
    before, let alone notice, my approach shall be initially introductory--<br />
    identifying general developments, making discriminations between old and new, 
    placing individual works within larger art-historical tendencies, identifying 
    important individuals, describing their works, analyzing major achievements 
    in considerable detail. Since my theme is formal evolution, these more extended 
    analyses will be formalist in method, not only characterizing the forms precisely 
    by illustrating how they relate to ostensible content; beyond that, I expect 
    to use whatever critical strategies (and essay lengths) the works demand. 
    While the body of the book will be organized around art-historical categories, 
    I expect to conclude it with short bio-bibliographical profiles of the major 
    figures. All this is to say that, the radicalism of this work notwithstanding, 
    my critical approach will be fairly traditional.</p>
  <p> To give a more specific sense of the literature I plan to discuss, I give 
    the following list of [seventy] writers and publications [ranging alphabetically 
    from Vito Acconci's selected writings/performances/installations to Paul Zelevansky's 
    books]. It should be clear that it is my aim to write a definitive critical 
    introduction to these works and what they represent in the evolving history 
    of literature in America, which is to say that I hope that this first book 
    on this emerging avant-garde will stand above all future essays on the same 
    material, because it is essentially correct in its selection of individuals, 
    its distribution of emphases, its identification of major esthetic developments 
    and its analysis of major works. In this respect, I hope that my critical 
    essay will be the equal of Marcel Raymond's ~From Baudelaire to Surrealism~ 
    (1933), L. Moholy-Nagy's ~Vision in Motion~ (1946), Martin Esslin's ~The Theatre 
    of the Absurd~ (1961) and P. Adams Sitney's ~Visionary Film~ (1974). It thus 
    aims to be better than other books that, by contrast, appear to be definitive 
    when they are first published but are later judged to be limited--for example, 
    Edmund Wilson's ~Axel's Castle~ (1931).</p>
  <p> It should also be clear that I would not propose this project unless I knew 
    it could (and should) go beyond my previous commentaries on this work--not 
    only that in ~The End of Intelligent Writing~ and the essays collected in 
    the second half of ~The Old Poetries and the New~ (1980) but in my general 
    introductions to the anthologies collecting the new writing: ~Imaged Words 
    &amp; Worded Images~ (1970), ~Future's Fictions~ (1971), ~Breakthrough Fictioneers~ 
    (1973), ~Essaying Essays~ (1975), ~Language &amp; Structure in North America~ 
    (1975), ~Text-Sound Texts~ (1980) and ~Scenarios~ (1981). This proposed history 
    is a book I plan to write from scratch, much as the books mentioned in the 
    previous paragraph were written from scratch; yet it will culminate my principal 
    critical interest of the past decade. The tentative title is &quot;The New 
    Literature in America.&quot;</p>
  <p> Although scholars of contemporary literature sometimes publish short reviews 
    of new books or extended critical articles on just one author or a single 
    work, I know of only one single-authored book partially on this period that 
    treats all genres together, as I plan to do; and that is Ihab Hassan's ~Contemporary 
    American Literature: 1945-72~ (1972), which incidentally acknowledges my own 
    contributions as a critic, poet and anthologist. However, this book hardly 
    touches upon the innovative literature I am favoring, although Hassan himself 
    has acknowledged it in his essays since then. The only prolific critic I know 
    with a strong sense of what is genuinely contemporary in American literature 
    today is Jerome Klinkowitz, who differs from me in writing all but entirely 
    about fiction and in concentrating upon writers whom I consistently take to 
    be less innovative. It is commonly understood that the literature I wish to 
    examine at length has no other serious comprehensive critic--that nobody else 
    is, as you say, as &quot;qualified&quot; to write the pioneering study that 
    is proposed in this application. ~(1980)~</p>

  <p>~&quot;ARTISTS' PROPOSALS: AN ASSEMBLING&quot;~</p>
  <p>For ~A Critical Assembling~ (1979, NEA-funded), Richard Kostelanetz solicited 
    camera-ready contributions and then published them in alphabetical order, 
    rather than, as in previous ~Assemblings~, collating thousands of pages the 
    contributors submitted to us. For a new ~Assembling~, entitled &quot;Artists' 
    Proposals,&quot; over one thousand American artists and art administrators 
    will be invited to respond to the following question: IF YOU COULD APPLY FOR 
    A GRANT OF $500,000, WHAT PRECISELY WOULD YOU PROPOSE TO DO? All responses 
    must be no more than one page in length, they must be camera-ready (as we 
    will not edit, typeset or &quot;reject&quot;), and they will be published 
    in alphabetical order. For a grant of seven thousand dollars, we estimate 
    that we can produce sixteen hundred copies of an 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; book 
    with 480 pages (on sixty-pound paper). Since 10 pages will be reserved for 
    house business, we will accept only the first 470 camera-ready submissions 
    to arrive at our P.O. Box. All contributors to ~Proposals~ will receive two 
    copies of the published book (representing choice &quot;readership&quot;); 
    the remainder of the edition will be sold through Jaap Reitman, Printed Matter 
    and the like. For obvious reasons, &quot;Artists' Proposals&quot; will be 
    dedicated to the Minnesota artist Don Celender. We believe that &quot;Proposals&quot; 
    should be the most marvelous, interesting, diversified and comprehensive collection 
    of fantasies, speculations and solid suggestions ever compiled anywhere. It 
    may also have a beneficial effect on U.S. arts funding and, ultimately, upon 
    American art. Assembling Press made a comparable application to the Literature 
    Program [of the NEA] for a &quot;Literary Proposals&quot; with an entirely 
    different collection of contributors. Gratified to do either one, we would 
    be especially pleased to do both. ~(1980)~</p>

  <p> Ideas alone can be works of art; they are in a chain of development that 
    may eventually find some form. All ideas need not be made physical.--Sol LeWitt, 
    &quot;Sentences on Concept|ual Art&quot; (1969)</p>
  <p>~A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF PUBLICLY FUNDED LITERARY GRANTING IN THE U.S.~</p>
  <p>Although the federal Arts and Humanities Councils were formed in the 1960s, 
    as a facet of Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society, it was not until the 1970s 
    that they blossomed and become, sheerly by the size of their beneficence, 
    a major cultural force. Indeed, the NEA, NEH and comparable regional organizations 
    have become such a prominent factor in American culture today that it is initially 
    hard for us to remember that ten years ago scarcely any of their activities 
    existed. This project proposes to ascertain critically what effects they have 
    had upon the creation and dissemination of American culture; but rather than 
    deal with the public funders in general, I expect to concentrate upon their 
    literature programs and literary granting, because literature is the cultural 
    area I know best--its personnel and issues are more familiar to me.</p>
  <p> Thus, the initial questions of my study are what effects has the growth 
    of public funding had upon American literature? Where have these programs 
    succeeded? And how have they failed? What are or should be their purposes? 
    How do American programs, both federal and state, compare with those in other 
    countries? What secondary effects have they had?</p>
  <p> My initial hypothesis is that they have influenced, often in subtle, unexpected 
    ways, the shape and tone of ~noncommercial~ cultural activity in the U.S., 
    and then that they all have serious problems, ranging from deleterious bias 
    to the mismanagement of internal information to scandals verging on corruption. 
    However, since the problems of one organization are not always present in 
    another, and no fault known to me is common to all cultural funding agencies, 
    my conclusion is that none is inevitable. A more critical hypothesis examines 
    the possibility of improvement, in part because of self-correcting experience 
    but also because of the salutary effects of outside criticism. (One informant, 
    a Canadian, suggested that in general the U.S. programs &quot;were ten years 
    behind the Canadian and twenty years behind the British.&quot;) A final intuition 
    is that the expected corruption--the undue influence of politicians upon their 
    selections--has scarcely occurred.</p>
  <p> As there is no known &quot;method&quot; for examining such institutions, 
    I expect to function as a critical intellectual historian, using statistics 
    and other empirical materials at some points and personal critical judgments 
    at others. There is no immediate model for this project, in part because American 
    intellectual historians have never before had government cultural funders 
    to study. (The WPA, by contrast, was simply an employer of last resort for 
    a limited number of artists and writers.) It could be said that this study 
    is about the impact of government intrusion into a domain that previously 
    lacked it, in part to compensate for cultural failures in the commercial process. 
    (Differences in &quot;produce&quot; notwithstanding, certain governmental 
    farm programs are in certain respects the most comparable precursor.)</p>
  <p> I take it that this project thus fits securely into your category of &quot;American 
    Society and Politics&quot; whose stated mandate is support of &quot;projects 
    that develop new perspectives on the evolution of modern American society 
    and that emphasize the interplay of ideas, values and institutions in the 
    emergence of our present civic culture.&quot; Speaking personally, I should 
    add that with my projected book I hope to do for public cultural funding what 
    my ~Literary Politics in America~ (1974, 1977) did for its subject--not only 
    demystify definitively but open a previously neglected subject to further 
    critical analysis. ~(1980)~</p>

  <p>~TEXT-SOUND TAPES~</p>
  <p>What is most necessary now for text-sound art to survive in America is a 
    recorded anthology of only the very best work, and with that principle in 
    mind may I offer the following proposal for a two-record long-playing set, 
    with times listed along with the pieces and their composers:</p>
  <p>~Side One~: Beth Anderson, &quot;If I Were a Poet,&quot; 1:15; Glenn Gould, 
    Prologue from ~The Idea of North~, 4:00; Steve Reich, &quot;It's Gonna Rain,&quot; 
    20:00; Norman Henry Pritchard II, &quot;Gyre's Galax,&quot; 3:00.</p>
  <p>~Side Two~: Bliem Kern, &quot;Jealousy,&quot; 1:16; Tom Johnson, &quot;gbda,&quot; 
    4:00; Charles Amirkhanian, &quot;Seatbelt, Seatbelt,&quot; 14:58; Richard 
    Kostelanetz, &quot;Praying to the Lord,&quot; 10:00.</p>
  <p>~Side Three~: Bliem Kern, &quot;Sound Poetry,&quot; 9:00; Jackson Mac Low, 
    &quot;The 1st Milarepa Gatha,&quot; 10:00; Jerome Rothenberg, &quot;10th Horse 
    Song,&quot; 4:10.</p>
  <p>~Side Four~: Charles Amirkhanian, &quot;Roussier (not Rouffier),&quot; 4:00; 
    Emmett Williams, &quot;Duet,&quot; 1:58; Four Horsemen, &quot;Allegro 108,&quot; 
    3:00; Toby Lurie, &quot;Innocence,&quot; 2:00; Charles Morrow, &quot;Sunchant,&quot; 
    3:50; Mary Ellen Solt, &quot;Zig-Zag,&quot; 5:00; John Cage, excerpts from 
    ~Empty Words~.</p>
  <p>With these pieces we have, in my judgment, not only the best American text-sound 
    art--a corpus of work that is good as the best European text-sound--but a 
    coherent sense of where this fertile intermedium might go. ~(1981)~</p>

  <p>~PUBLIC ART PROJECT FOR PORTLAND~</p>
  <p>What I am proposing for the ceiling of the Justice Building arcade is a multiple 
    sequence--a set of visual narratives, if you will--that can be comprehensibly 
    &quot;read&quot; in six different ways: (1) from its far left end to its far 
    right end; (2) from its far right end to its far left end; (3) from the middle 
    to the left end (from image #8 to image #15); (4) from the middle to the right 
    end (or from #8 to #1); (5) from the left end to the middle; (6) from the 
    right end to the middle. In each narrative, there is a beginning to the sequence, 
    a complication, a denouement and an end. While this work has beginnings and 
    ends, the individual images have neither tops nor bottoms and are thus equally 
    present to the eye from any viewing angle.</p>
  <p> The overall scheme is mostly symmetrical--as befits a building that is, 
    as far as I can tell, likewise mostly symmetrical both in its overall design 
    and its individual designs (e.g., the lamps).</p>
  <p> What are now ink lines on the drawings will be made entirely of black mosaic 
    tiles 3/4&quot; wide against a background of white tiles, while pencil lines 
    portray gray tile also 3/4&quot; wide. These pencil lines thus represent &quot;ghosts&quot; 
    echoing both the dark diagonal lines within their images and their mirrors 
    within the scheme. All lines will run to the edges of the coffers, and the 
    blacks and whites will be as black and white as possible, better to reflect 
    the lights directed at them. The tabletops will have patterns whose ratios 
    correspond to those on the ceilings immediately above them. The lamps will 
    be hung at the distance we discover most effective for illuminating the ceiling. 
    (This last fact would be impossible to determine in advance of on-site experiments.)</p>
  <p> The individual designs have the scale of 1/2&quot; to 1', because larger 
    drawings seemed unnecessary.</p>
  <p> I wish I had sufficient information to present a comprehensive budget, but 
    this has not been easy to ascertain. Nonetheless, it seems reasonable to expect 
    that the extra costs of putting my works onto the tiles of the ceiling would 
    not exceed that of the available funds.</p>
  <p> I hope that my work will engage attention, rather than distract it, and 
    that it will be regarded, both by those who experience the space daily and 
    by those who see it only once, as major contributions to public art. ~(1981)~</p>

  <p>~THE BOOK PUBLICATION OF &quot;EPIPHANIES&quot;~</p>
  <p>&quot;Epiphanies&quot; is large collection in progress of single-sentence 
    fictions, over two thousand in number at last count, that have no intentional 
    connection to one another. Excerpts have appeared in literary periodicals, 
    on videotape, in radio plays both extended and brief, on cards in a gallery 
    exhibition, as the sound track of a film (one in German, another in English), 
    and in live theatrical performances, both here and abroad. A selection of 
    German translations will be published as a small paperback in 1983 by Literarisches 
    Colloquium Berlin. In a book version, these Epiphanies should appear in physically 
    separate blocks of type, several to a page, ideally in a variety of typefaces 
    (to reinforce the fundamental idea that these are indeed distinctly separate 
    stories), with plenty of separation between them (forcing the reader to acknowledge 
    space as he or she moves from one to another). As the stories themselves are 
    not intrinsically difficult, especially after their principle is understood, 
    the book should attract fiction readers willing to appreciate a series of 
    surprises whose theme is the exhaustive experience of the experience of fiction. 
    My own recommendation would be that &quot;Epiphanies&quot; be published in 
    two editions--a 6&quot; x 9&quot; trade paperback and a 10 3/4&quot; x 16 
    1/8&quot; hardback, photographically enlarged 180 percent (so that individual 
    Epiphanies would come to resemble newspaper headlines). Publishers should 
    consider &quot;Epiphanies&quot; an opportunity for innovative design and typesetting--for 
    doing something different not only from what they usually do but from what 
    others have done. If the publisher wishes, the author would be able to take 
    charge of the design and deliver camera-ready copy. ~(1982)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~UNITED STATES/JAPAN EXCHANGE FELLOWSHIP~</p>
  <p>1. Further work in producing Audio Art in languages other than English. (One 
    of the enclosed sample audiotapes, ~Invocations~, contains speech in two dozen 
    languages other than English. I am presently completing a sixty-minute radio 
    program, entirely in German, on commission from the ~HÃ¶rspiel~ department 
    of Westdeutscher Rundfunk.)</p>
  <p>2. Collecting more &quot;outtakes&quot; (by other filmmakers) for &quot;Epiphanies,&quot; 
    which is a universal film in progress designed to be at least 240 minutes 
    in duration, composed from over a thousand outtakes/excerpts so far gathered 
    only in Germany and in the U.S. (The sample was made in Berlin; footage of 
    equal length has already been gathered in the U.S., but not yet incorporated 
    into this early draft.)</p>
  <p>3. Exploring the possibility of preparing a sound track in Japanese for the 
    film ~Epiphanies~.</p>
  <p>4. Creating original video and holography, probably with imagery of language, 
    in English or Japanese or both.</p>
  <p>5. Meeting with friends, correspondents and friends of both correspondents 
    and friends.</p>
  <p>6. A greater understanding of Japanese approaches to media and art. ~(1982)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~&quot;LOVINGS&quot;: A BOOK~</p>
  <p>&quot;Lovings&quot; is a collection of autonomous single-sentence fictions 
    that aims to include within a single text (and context) a multitude of erotic 
    experiences. Whereas most erotic writing is about one thing, this is meant 
    to be about everything. Periodical editors are invited to select the ones 
    they wish to publish. Those individual stories can then be run in whatever 
    order an editor prefers. Please allow in the design and typography sufficient 
    space (or distance) to establish that these are separate stories, with no 
    particular connection to one another, other than common subject. My own recommendation 
    would be that the designer use different typefaces for adjacent stories and, 
    better yet, that blocks of type be floated in the space of the page (or the 
    magazine column). Another suggestion is that a periodical interested in using 
    a good deal of the text consider publishing their selections as a kind of 
    serial, with a dozen or two stories in each successive issue, the whole thus 
    functioning as a continuing feature to which readers might immediately turn 
    as they open each new issue. Stories from &quot;Lovings&quot; may well be 
    published as a book of similar design. Beyond that, these &quot;Lovings&quot; 
    could, with the aid of a sophisticated character-generator, also become the 
    content of a videotape and the base of a feature-length film. ~(1982)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~RADIO PRODUCTION~</p>
  <p>1. Further work in audio art with religious texts. These tapes will use multitracking, 
    tape-delay, voice-modification, computer-assisted voice resynthesis and other 
    sophisticated techniques. Some will be produced at the Brooklyn College Center 
    for Computer Music, where I have a gratis residency.</p>
  <p>2. The preparation of a five-hour continuous tape of &quot;Epiphanies,&quot; 
    a collection of over two thousand single-sentence stories read by over fifty 
    people. Two thirds was already recorded at WBAI-FM, New York.</p>
  <p>3. The preparation of a series of feature programs on &quot;The Sound of 
    Literature,&quot; which cover an area between sound poetry and audio art on 
    one side and high literary declamation on the other. It will include commentary 
    by the producer and/or interviews with the authors. Sample subjects: Glenn 
    Gould (on his radio documentaries), Allen Ginsberg reading Jack Kerouac's 
    &quot;Old Angel Midnight,&quot; Klaus SchÃ¶ning on ~Neue HÃ¶rspiel~, Mauricio 
    Kagel, Sten Hanson, James Theobald, Donald Hall on poets' readings, Jackson 
    Mac Low, John Giorno, Gertrude Stein's sound poetry, Charles Dodge, Bliem 
    Kern, Jerome Rothenberg's Horse Songs, Gerhard Ruhm, Eberhard Blum performing 
    Kurt Schwitters's ~Ursonate~, Vachel Lindsay reading &quot;The Congo,&quot; 
    Carl Sandberg, Barbara Stoler Miller chanting Sanskrit poetry, Norman Henry 
    Pritchard II, The Last Poets, Ralph Ellison reading the preface to ~Invisible 
    Man~ (private tape in hand), Charles Amirkhanian, Lord Buckley, etc. ~(1982)~</p>

  <p>~TRANSLATING &quot;EPIPHANIES&quot;~</p>
  <p>&quot;Epiphanies&quot; is a large collection of single-sentence stories each 
    of which is meant to be the key moment, or the epiphany in the James Joycean 
    sense, of a larger, otherwise nonexistent story. As each is a discrete unit, 
    there are no intentional connections among the stories.</p>
  <p> Given such thorough disconnection, translating them into another language 
    became more of a problem than we initially supposed. Most professional translators 
    are especially skilled at rendering their native language consistent--they 
    know how to assimilate a style in another language and then create a comparable 
    coherent style in their own language. They impose consistency by, among other 
    things, making sure that each time a certain phrase appears in the original 
    text it is translated with the exact same words. </p>
  <p> With &quot;Epiphanies,&quot; however, just the opposite is required. Given 
    the premise of the utter independence of each story, it would be better if 
    the translation had a variety of styles--if, say, the same phrases were translated 
    in various ways. Unsuccessful in our quest for an individual translator to 
    do the entire text into German, we realized it would be better to organize 
    a squad of translators--indeed, a populous team with both professionals and 
    amateurs. The stories, cut into individual slips, were laid out on tables. 
    Two dozen translators were then invited to select the ones they wanted to 
    translate. I as the author was present to answer particular questions about 
    meaning. My publisher checked the translations for accuracy. Within four hours 
    a thousand stories were German--such being the effectiveness of American-style 
    mass production; and a good time was had by all, to whom I am grateful, not 
    only for their participation in this experiment in translation but for their 
    idiosyncratic German words. (Now it might be interesting, if not appropriate, 
    to organize yet another team to retranslate these German Epiphanies back into 
    English.)</p>
  <p> This unusual method could be applied to translations of &quot;Epiphanies&quot; 
    into other languages. ~(1982)~</p>

  <p> Regarded in isolation, an idea may be quite insignificant, and venturesome 
    in the extreme, but it may acquire importance from an idea which follows it; 
    perhaps, in a certain collocation with other ideas, which may seem equally 
    absurd, it may be capable of furnishing a very serviceable link.--Friedrich 
    Schiller, as quoted by Sigmund Freud, ~The Interpretation of Dreams~ (1913).</p>
  <p>~&quot;ALL ALONG THE EDGE&quot;: A RICHARD KOSTELANETZ READER~</p>
  <p>This would collect the best of his works, in all genres and media, between 
    a single set of covers, representing comprehensively a versatile and prolific 
    American author. It will open with selections from his ~Autobiographies~, 
    including the &quot;Self-Profile&quot; of 1969 and his &quot;Autochronology&quot; 
    of 1980, and then have two of his journalistic profiles, one of Glenn Gould 
    and the other of Gertrude Stein. Then come selections from his literary criticism: 
    the introduction to ~The New American Arts~ (1965), the introduction to ~Twelve 
    from the Sixties~ (1967), the introduction to ~The Theatre of Mixed Means~ 
    (1968), the opening chapter of ~The End of Intelligent Writing~ (1974), as 
    well as such polemics as &quot;A Magazine of Verse&quot; and &quot;The New 
    Class.&quot; A third section will be devoted to his writings on art: essays 
    on Charles Ives, Moholy-Nagy, recent American music, artists' self-books, 
    in addition to essays on his own art--<br />
    &quot;Book Art&quot; and &quot;Art Autobiography.&quot; A fifth section of 
    the book will be devoted to selections from his creative work, as well as 
    prefaces about them. Visual poems: Disintegration, Manifestos, Live-Die, Concentric, 
    Tributes to Henry Ford, Me, The East Village. Visual fictions: Biography, 
    Come Here, Football Forms, Replicate, Passage, Impose, Ripening, March. Verbal 
    fictions: Milestones in a Life, Dialogue, Plateaux, the first section of ~Foreshortenings~, 
    excerpts from both ~Openings &amp; Closings~ and ~Epiphanies~. Numerical art: 
    1024, Two Intervals, Increments, Exhaustive Parallel Intervals, etc. Experimental 
    prose: Declaration of Independence, Recyclings, Conspandextract. The conclusion 
    of this section will include stills from his films and videotapes, photographs 
    of his holograms, and production notes on his audio art. The book will open 
    with a new introduction and close with an elaborate bibliography. As an introduction 
    to work that is currently scattered in many places, this &quot;Reader&quot; 
    should run about four hundred pages,6&quot; x 9&quot;, and perhaps use, whenever 
    possible, original printings for offset reproduction. ~(1982)~</p>

  <p>~AN AMERICAN TELEVISION VERSION OF A GERMAN FILM ABOUT PRE-WWII BERLIN~</p>
  <p>In the Wiessensee section of (East) Berlin is the largest Jewish cemetery 
    in Europe (with over 110,000 graves). Founded in 1880, mostly intact, it is 
    a surviving representation of Berlin Jewry (and Berlin as a whole) between 
    1880 and 1940, when Berlin had the largest Jewish population of any city between 
    Warsaw and New York and when Berlin's Jews, though never more than five percent 
    of the total population, had a disproportionate prominence. In the cemetery 
    as a whole one sees the culture of Berlin's Jews at this time, confidently 
    constructing mausoleums that they expected their children would visit and 
    honor, if not aspiring to be buried nearby, in sum revealing their innocent 
    assumption that Jews (and everyone else) would survive and prosper forever 
    in the promised land of Berlin. In the details of many gravestones the viewer 
    can imagine not only individual lives but the culture of a community. What 
    we are doing is an imaginative documentary about this cemetery as an evocative 
    relic of this lost Berlin.</p>
  <p> The film opens with the front gate of the cemetery; and after the titles, 
    the camera tours down the honor row, culminating with the gravestone of Leo 
    Baeck, Berlin's last great rabbi, but, as it swings around, revealing that 
    only his wife is buried here. (Baeck, in fact, is buried in London.) From 
    here onward, the graves are shown in mostly chronological sequence, beginning 
    with the cemetery's first stone (1880). We go through the mausoleums of the 
    pre-WWI period to the interior burial ground devoted exclusively to those 
    Berlin Jews who died in WWI. After this is a stone honoring Russian war prisoners 
    who happened to die in Berlin. The film then progresses into the postwar period, 
    beginning with a spectacular tour of the mausoleums along the cemetery's outer 
    wall, the camera's eye reminding us of the sky under which all are buried. 
    As the survey approaches the Hitler period, we see companion stones belonging 
    to the parents of Kurt Tucholsky, the father dead at the beginning of the 
    century, his grave topped with ivy, the mother dead at Theresienstadt, her 
    ground space empty. The film shows the stones of couples who died in the same 
    year, and then couples who died on the same day in October 1942: double suicides 
    on the verge of imminent deportation. In short, the visual track of the film 
    consists only of scenes from the cemetery. The sound track consists of Berliners 
    and ex-Berliners talking about the cemetery in the prewar period. The current 
    version, roughly twenty-one minutes long, was composed under a grant to Literarisches 
    Colloquium Berlin from the Berlin Senat. This grant, for &quot;low-budget&quot; 
    productions, is intended to produce short films for projection in standard 
    German moviehouses.</p>
  <p> We are petitioning for support for an English-language version scaled for 
    television. This means that certain scenes will need to be reshot so that 
    the words, now enlarged, can be read on the smaller television screens; the 
    opening walk down the honor row will need to be slower. We will also need 
    more stills of stones to fill out the twenty-eight-minutes slot that is standard 
    in the U.S. And we shall need to compose a separate sound track from the English 
    portions of those interviewed for the earlier film. *** Those interviewed 
    have become a de facto advisory committee, aware of what we were doing before 
    we shot a single roll: [listed]. To them add the following advisers: [listed]. 
    Research for the film was done in l981-82, during my residency in Berlin as 
    a guest of the DAAD Kunstlerprogramm; the interviews and filming were done 
    in 1983.</p>
  <p> We also propose to produce, from sound materials not used in the film, an 
    audio documentary, a radio program, about Jewish life in prewar Berlin. This 
    will run sixty minutes and be offered initially to English-language stations 
    that have previously broadcast my works: Canadian Broadcasting, Australian 
    Broadcasting, National Public Radio and Pacifica Stations. *** It is possible 
    that we will later produce versions of the film with sound tracks in Hebrew 
    and Swedish, among other languages, again based upon interviews with surviving 
    ex-Berliners. *** We may also produce both a book and a museum installation 
    about the Cemetery. Each of these latter media has the advantage of allowing 
    the inclusion of more stones (and thus more names); the main disadvantage 
    of the book is that photographs must necessarily be black-and-white. Neither 
    of these media can equal film in introducing the cemetery and in evoking the 
    experience of visiting the remarkable place.</p>
  <p> One sub-theme that connects this project to the author's previous work is 
    the sense that gravestones in this period constitute a kind of visual poetry, 
    or can be appreciated as visual poetry. To be precise, I consider the experience 
    of the cemetery to be about visual history, or the evocation of history through 
    visual artifacts. All cemeteries &quot;live,&quot; but to different degrees; 
    and in my experience, none is as historically evocative as this. *** We expect 
    to obtain permission to shoot again in the Cemetery. Ask any filmmaker who 
    has worked in East Germany and you'll understand how difficult this is. Since 
    the German version was a success, we assume that we can come again. *** Among 
    the television outlets asking to see the final English film are WNET, New 
    York, and Sender Freies Berlin, which previously aired a Kostelanetz-Koerber 
    film. ~(1983)~</p>

  <p>~PROPOSAL FOR LINE BOOK-ART COMPETITION~</p>
  <p>Working with the concept of &quot;Constructivist Fictions,&quot; I have produced 
    several hundred pages of sequential line drawings. Some of these sequences 
    or &quot;stories&quot; appeared in two collections, ~Constructs~ (1975) and 
    ~Constructs Two~ (1978), as well as numerous literary magazines here and abroad. 
    Rather than produce more collections in this mode, I think it would now be 
    more interesting to incorporate many of these several-page sequences into 
    a single narrative titled &quot;Intermix&quot; that would extend the following 
    organizational principles for its entire length: Page one of &quot;Intermix&quot; 
    would be page one of story A (as untitled now as the others); page two would 
    be B1; page 3, C1; page 4, A2; page 5, D1; page 6, B2; page 7, E1; page 8, 
    A3, and so forth. Therefore, each new page of &quot;Intermix&quot; would either 
    continue a previously established narrative or initiate a new one. The book 
    I propose to do of this material would contain at least 500 images on 500 
    sheets, photocopied on only one side, in edition of seventy-five copies (which 
    is an appropriate number for a book so thick), and then perfectbound with 
    a wrap-around cover of heavier stock. The cost of photocopying and collating 
    500 sheets of 25% cotton content paper would run at least 4 cents per sheet, 
    bringing the cost of each book to at least $20.00 for the pages alone. The 
    cover and binding would be $6.00 or so per book, bringing the total costs 
    for seventy-five copies to nearly two thousand dollars. I would expect to 
    match your grant with my own funds, in addition to doing all the artwork and 
    overseeing the book's production. Though I have previously produced book-art 
    books in an incomparable variety of sizes, editions, subjects and modes, the 
    proposed &quot;Intermix,&quot; in the structure of its materials and its physical 
    composition, resembles no other book I have done. ~(1983)~</p>

  <p>Rabelais indulged in the conception of visionary cities, as did other great 
    writers of the times, among them Shakespeare and Cervantes. In Shakespeare's 
    play ~The Tempest~, Prospero and Miranda find themselves on a distant island, 
    again set within the utopian tradition of an arcadian analogy, which is envisioned 
    by Gonzalo as the incarnation of nature in man, &quot;the opportunity to organize 
    a community untainted by competition or the shadow of ambition, an arcadian 
    anarchy founded upon the permission given to each of its members to follow 
    his own instincts.--Udo Kultermann, ~Visible Cities--Invisible Cities~ (n.d.)</p>
  <p>~&quot;EPIPHANIES&quot; IN SEVERAL MEDIA~</p>
  <p>My principal creative project these past few years has been &quot;Epiphanies,&quot; 
    which is a collection of over two thousand discrete single-sentence stories 
    which can be &quot;published&quot; in several forms:</p>
  <p>1. A set of at least three thick pocket-size volumes with one story on each 
    page, printed not across the shorter dimension, as in conventional books, 
    but parallel to the longer side of the page.<br />
    2. A series of audiotapes of at least ten hours' total duration in which nearly 
    every story would be individually dramatized.<br />
    3. A theatrical version, as outlined in my anthology ~Scenarios~ (l980), with 
    at least fifteen performers distributed among the audience in a nontheatrical 
    space (say, a ballroom or a gymnasium).<br />
    4. A series of videotapes, likewise at least ten hours' total duration, in 
    which the texts of the stories would appear on the screen, one at a time, 
    with letters produced by a video character-generator.<br />
    5. A museum exhibition for which the stories would be typeset with headline-sized 
    letters and individually mounted on 8&quot; x 10&quot; boards which would 
    be distributed throughout a space.<br />
    6. A film composed of Epiphanies found in other filmmakers' footage (&quot;outtakes&quot;)--at 
    least a thousand excerpts for a film of four hours' duration. (The sound track 
    for this film would come from #2 above.)<br />
    7. An operatic version with additional musical material by Bruce Kushnick; 
    here some Epiphanies would be of words alone, others of music alone and yet 
    others of both words and music, used in the widest variety of complementary 
    ways.<br />
    8. Boxes of cards, with one story to a card.<br />
    9. Other realizations no doubt inspired by the first eight. ~(1983)~</p>

  <p>~AMERICAN POETS &amp; RECORDING TECHNOLOGIES~</p>
  <p>This series of twenty-six thirty-minute radio programs will progress through 
    three kinds of material: (1) The earliest recordings of American poets. (2) 
    The classic recordings of that generation of native poets who were prominent 
    between the Wars. (3) Post-War American poets' direct involvement with recording 
    technology. This section will feature, for one program apiece, the audio literature 
    of John Giorno, John Cage, Norman Henry Pritchard, Dick Higgins, Jerome Rothenberg, 
    Raymond Federman, Charles Amirkhanian, Beth Anderson, Jackson Mac Low et al., 
    with introductions, examples and interviews by me. ~(1983)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~FURTHER WORK ON VIDEO &quot;EPIPHANIES&quot;~</p>
  <p>Single-sentence stories appear on the screen in typography made with a video 
    character-generator. The sample tape was made on an elementary letter-making 
    machine, donated to the author-typesetter; it was limited to a single size 
    and style of type arrayed in a grid that is ten lines high and twenty-eight 
    characters wide. With sufficient funding, we hope to rent a character-<br />
    generator with more possibilities in the presentation of language: a machine 
    that can, say, create typefaces of various styles and sizes, whose words can 
    emerge from any place in the visual field or can expand in size within the 
    visual field, whose words can flip and turn like acrobats, which can present 
    the words within a sentence in an irregular sequential flow, etc. We plan 
    to make at least four hours of videotape that can then be divided into lengths 
    most appropriate for distribution (8 x 30 minutes, l6 x l5 minutes, or 48 
    x 5 minutes). A sound track especially for this work will be composed by Charles 
    Dodge, the master of computer-assisted speech synthesis and the director of 
    the Brooklyn College Center for Computer Music. (He has previously produced 
    Richard Kostelanetz texts for Swedish Radio.) ~(1983)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~A MUSEUM EXHIBITION ABOUT THE GREAT JEWISH CEMETERY OF BERLIN~</p>
  <p>In the Weissensee section of (East) Berlin is the largest Jewish cemetery 
    in Western Europe (with over 110,000 graves). Founded in 1880, it is the principal 
    surviving representation of the great age of Berlin Jewry (and, by extension, 
    of the Lost Berlin), when Berlin had the largest Jewish population of any 
    city between Warsaw and New York, when Berlin's Jews, though never more than 
    five percent of the total population, had a disproportionate, spectacular 
    influence. Looking at the gravestones of the pre-Hitler period, one can imaginatively 
    reconstruct from visual, verbal and numerical detail not only individual lives 
    but images of a community wealthy and confident, constructing stylish mausoleums 
    that they expected would be visited and honored by their children and grandchildren, 
    who would of course aspire to be buried nearby. By contrast, in the stone 
    of a husband and wife who committed suicide on the same day in 1942 is the 
    conclusive destruction of this dream. (And the modest stones of the post-WWII 
    period tell yet another evocative story.)</p>
  <p> During a residency in Berlin (West) as a guest of the DAAD Kunstlerprogramm, 
    I took a large number of photographs of gravestones, mostly in black-and-white, 
    that I initially envisioned for a 6&quot; x 9&quot; book about the Cemetery, 
    as well as color slides that were initially intended to accompany concert 
    performances of an audiotape &quot;Kaddish&quot; that I am presently making. 
    However, once the slides were developed, it became vividly clear that color 
    prints of these slides (which have negatives) could become a museum exhibition. 
    (The fact that the cemetery lies physically in ~East~ Germany makes an exhibition 
    more necessary.) Since my interpretation of the significance of the cemetery 
    depends upon the abundant accumulation of evocative details, my vision of 
    this visual history has at least two hundred color prints, 8&quot; x l0&quot;, 
    with horizontal photographs mounted one above the other, the vertical ones 
    by themselves, with footnotes, as needed, and succinct statements gathered 
    from the literature about Berlin Jews (and a few of my own), in large type 
    on cards, say, l8&quot; x l2&quot;, interspersed between. Other exhibition 
    formats are no doubt possible. In these color prints is also sufficient material 
    for a memorable catalogue. ~(1983)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~A THEATRICAL &quot;EPIPHANIES&quot;~</p>
  <p>&quot;Epiphanies&quot; is a large number of single-sentence &quot;lines&quot; 
    that are available for theatrical performance. Since these are meant to be 
    the resonant key lines--Epiphanies, in the Joycean sense--of longer, otherwise 
    nonexistent narratives, my principal request of the performers is that they 
    read each sentence in ways that evocatively communicate their sense of what 
    the remaining, implicit story might be. Any number of performers may sit or 
    stand as they wish, in a proscenium or an open space; and there is no need 
    to costume or mime any activities, since it is assumed that most, if not all, 
    of the action is in the lines and how they are spoken. The performers are 
    functioning more like musicians who play their solos on cue. For the premiere 
    performance, with both faculty and students at the University of North Dakota, 
    the lines were read one line at a time, with pauses between, by four informally 
    dressed performers distributed around the circumference of a circle made by 
    the audience seated in the middle. (This was an inversion of the traditional 
    theater-in-the-round.) From the ten-thousand-word manuscript of single-sentence 
    lines, the director chose those she preferred, had them typed on individual 
    3&quot; x 5&quot; cards and then distributed these cards over large tables, 
    inviting the four performers to choose those Epiphanies each felt he or she 
    could articulate best. The director then assigned some of the remaining Epiphanies 
    to those performers ~she~ thought could render them best. (No director is 
    obliged to use all the lines; none of them is necessarily more essential to 
    the whole than any of the others.) Appropriate direction should emphasize 
    the individuality of each story and thus avoid, in the ordering of elements, 
    suggesting any relation between the story at hand and any other near it. Though 
    the original production had stories emerging in succession from various points 
    around a circle, with the director on a podium in the middle (functioning 
    more like an orchestral conductor in revising entrances and speech volume), 
    I allow that other directors might want to have them spoken, if not dramatized, 
    in other ways and set in other kinds of theatrical spaces. A subsequent production, 
    exclusively with students at Vassar College, took place within an art exhibition 
    gallery, with spectators scattered about; and since this director instructed 
    her dozen performers to speak often in canon or unison, she used three times 
    as many stories within a production that took just as long as the initial 
    one--forty-five minutes. Moreover, as the order of the lines need not be fixed, 
    I could envision the director changing the sequence from performance to performance 
    in an extended run, or the performers exchanging Epiphanies with one another, 
    in part to keep their renditions continually fresh. There is no doubt in my 
    mind that different groups will (and should) perform &quot;Epiphanies&quot; 
    in totally different ways, much as Gertrude Stein's similarly open texts are 
    susceptible to radically different theatrical interpretations, and lengths 
    could vary from a few minutes to several hours, much like the works of John 
    Cage. (Video and audio renditions are also possible.) Despite variations in 
    interpretation, the text has its own intelligence; it will always be about 
    one theme that is unique to it: the exhaustive experience of the experience 
    of story.</p>
  <p> Since &quot;Epiphanies&quot; is conceptually so different from standard 
    theatrical texts, potential producers and directors are asked first to consider 
    whether they can (or wish to) realize the concept; and if this sounds feasible 
    to you (or at least ~not~ impracticable), please write me for a copy of the 
    entire text. ~(1983)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p> What the work of art looks like isn't too important. It has to look like 
    something if it has physical form. No matter what form it may finally have 
    it must begin with an idea. It is the process of conception and realization 
    with which the artist is concerned. . . . If the artist carries through his 
    idea and makes it into visible form, then all the steps in the process are 
    of importance. The idea itself, even if not made visual is as much a work 
    of art as any finished product. All intervening steps--scribbles, sketches, 
    drawings, failed work, models, studies, thoughts, conversations--are of interest. 
    Those that show the thought processes of the artist are sometimes more interesting 
    than the final product.--Sol LeWitt, &quot;Paragraphs on Conceptual Art&quot; 
    (1967)</p>
  <p>~AN EXHIBITION OF &quot;EPIPHANIES&quot;~</p>
  <p>&quot;Epiphanies&quot; is the collective title for over two thousand single-sentence 
    stories--Epiphanies in the Joycean sense--that have been &quot;published&quot; 
    in several media: in literary journals, as a book (in German, l983), in two 
    radically different theatrical performances (both of which are preserved on 
    videotape), as a radio play several hours long, on a videotape that exploits 
    the technology's unique capabilities of electronic character-generation, and 
    in a film. What is proposed is a complete exhibition of this project, an exhibition 
    that would draw upon the multi-media capabilities of American museums and 
    universities. This exhibition should ideally include:<br />
    1. The mounting of over two thousand cards, each 4&quot; x 6&quot;, over the 
    gallery space.<br />
    2. The display of the book(s) and of versions previously published in literary 
    magazines (whose editors were encouraged to select the stories they liked 
    best and then print them in whatever order they thought best).<br />
    3. Videocassettes of earlier theatrical productions and of the version produced 
    with a character-generator and audiocassettes of the radio play; all cassettes 
    should be available in the exhibition space for insertion into appropriate 
    playing equipment, as individual viewers request.<br />
    4. A fresh production of the theatrical text, which is susceptible to various 
    interpretations; this should coincide with the exhibition's opening.<br />
    5. Occasional screenings, perhaps twice a week, of the film that is, at last 
    count, seventy minutes long and will soon be much longer. (It would also be 
    possible to make a separate installation of this film, which could be divided 
    into four equal parts, and then projected continuously and simultaneously 
    onto four screens at four points of the compass, while a single sound track, 
    drawn from the radio performance, would be broadcast over the installation 
    space.)<br />
    6. The presentation, at the conclusion of the exhibition, of the &quot;musical&quot; 
    version, with a score for small ensemble by Bruce Kushnick. (This, like the 
    theatrical version, is suitable for student-amateur performers.) It should 
    be noted that in every form &quot;Epiphanies&quot; is concerned with the same 
    things--those heightened moments that are the Epiphanies, or cohering climaxes, 
    of longer stories and then the exhaustive experience of the experience of 
    fiction; the theme of the project as a whole is the experimental exploration 
    of different media as vehicles for story-telling. </p>
  <p> Possible sponsors can consider copies of previously published versions and 
    of sample exhibition cards, slides of images from the videotape and the film, 
    videotapes of the earlier theatrical performances and of an earlier, twenty-eight-minute 
    version of the film. Interested sponsors should consider applying to appropriate 
    departments of the National Endowment for the Arts for matching funds. The 
    author-artist would like to participate in the production and design of an 
    appropriate catalogue. Those interested in exhibiting &quot;Epiphanies&quot; 
    should contact him. ~(1983)~</p>

  <p>~AN ANTHOLOGY OF NEW AMERICAN RADIO ART~</p>
  <p>This book will contain scripts, texts, retrospective descriptions and other 
    printable materials about creative (non-documentary) radio programs designed 
    not to adapt live theater or, mostly, even to create the illusion of live 
    theater, but to exploit the unique possibilities of strictly audio experience. 
    Selections tentatively include: Archibald MacLeish, ~Fall of the City~; Norman 
    Corwin, ~Daybreak~; Lucille Fletcher, ~Sorry Wrong Number~; Violet Atkins, 
    ~The Return to Berchtesgaden~; Norman Rosten, ~Paris Incident~; Kenneth Patchen, 
    ~The City Wears a Slouch Hat~; Bob (Elliott) &amp; Ray (Goulding), ~Spelling 
    Bee~; John Cage, ~Roaratorio~; R. Murray Schafer, ~Dream Passage~; Michael 
    Palmer, ~Idem I-V~; Beth Anderson, ~Riot Rot~; Sandra Braman, ~Vellum~; Albert 
    T. Cook, ~Recall~; Larry Johnson, ~Weorald~; Peter Ganick, ~Targets~; Welch 
    D. Everman, ~Trio and Duet~; Doug Kahn, ~Ronald Reagan Speaks for Himself~; 
    Carol Adorjan, ~Portions Mechanically Reproduced~; Stephen Dixon, ~Hugh~; 
    Lawrence Weiner, ~Need To Know~; Francis Schwartz, ~The Madness (?) de Robert 
    Schumann~; Henry H. Roth, ~Hotline~; Bern Porter, ~Abu-Abu~; Glenn Gould, 
    ~Arnold Schoenberg~; Jackson Mac Low, ~Dialog Unter Dichtern/Dialog Among 
    Poets~; Richard Barnes, ~Radio 66~; Alison Knowles, ~Bean Sequence~; Anson 
    Kenney, ~Conceptual Radio: Five Performances~; Reuben Ship, ~The Investigator~; 
    John Chu, ~Out of My Mind~; Richard Kostelanetz, ~The Gospels/Die Evangelien~</p>
  <p> In the editor's opinion, these are not only the radio texts that propose 
    how best to exploit the medium; they are also include many of the best ever 
    written in this country. The German word ~hÃ¶rspiel~ is used, because it simultaneously 
    expands and elevates the prosaic notion of &quot;radio plays.&quot; To make 
    this selection, the editor read all the historical anthologies; he also asked 
    service magazines in both radio and literature to publish announcements of 
    the project. (The response was approximately a hundred original manuscripts, 
    ten of which are included above.) Several texts were edited at his suggestion; 
    others were produced especially in response to his interest. The book as a 
    whole will run approximately five hundred pages, and it will be, incidentally, 
    the first anthology of North American Radio Plays in over thirty-five years. 
    Like its immediate precursors in the editor's own history--~Text-Sound Texts~ 
    (Morrow, l980) and ~Scenarios~ (Assembling, 1980)--this book will contain 
    a critical introduction. Publishers interested in contracting it should contact 
    him. ~(1983)~</p>

  <p>~AN EXHIBITION OF THE UNIQUE PUBLISHING PROGRAM OF THE FUTURE PRESS~</p>
  <p>Established and directed by Richard Kostelanetz, himself a noted critic and 
    anthologist of experimental writing, The Future Press is devoted exclusively 
    to radically alternative materials for literature and alternative forms of 
    books. Toward the realization of these aims, its publications have so far 
    included a visual fiction in the form of a poster that must be cut out and 
    taped into a polyhedron that contains a multipath maze (Bob Heman's ~The Journey~); 
    a typographically inventive visual-verbal essay, 40&quot; x 26&quot;, of remarks 
    (in French) about the Marquis de Sade (Paul Nagy's ~SadisfactionS~); a set 
    of seven cards of numerical art (Kostelanetz's ~Numbers Two~); a minimal fiction, 
    with no more than two words to a paragraph, in two radically different book 
    formats-<br />
    -folded newsprint, 11&quot; x 17&quot;, and a spine-bound paperback, 5 1/4&quot; 
    x 4&quot; (Kostelanetz's ~One Night Stood~); the most spectacular individual 
    collection of verbal-visual poetry ever published in this country (Ian Tarnman's 
    ~First Principles~); and Kostelanetz's third one-man collection of his visual 
    poetry, ~Illuminations~. Upon receipt of expected grants, the Future Press 
    will publish the collected verbal-visual essays of Loris Essary and Carl D. 
    Clark; Bob Heman's ~Roads~, which will contains one hundred 2&quot; cubes 
    of visual fictional material--cubes that can be variably arranged in three 
    dimensions; ~Particulars~ and ~Exhaustive Combinations~ by Jean-Jacques Cory, 
    who works exclusively with words in lists; ~Zoomorph~, a four-color, 23&quot; 
    x 29&quot; poster-book-scenario by Fred Truck, winner of the ~Kontexts~ 1976 
    international &quot;originality award&quot;; an audiocassette of previously 
    uncollected text-sound pieces by Jackson Mac Low and W. Bliem Kern; an anthology 
    of New York State sound poets; and several formally related, structurally 
    alternative books by Richard Kostelanetz (including his film ~Constructivist 
    Fictions~ made in collaboration with Peter Longauer). In the proposed exhibition, 
    all available works will go on display: the posters and book pages on the 
    walls; the book-<br />
    sculptures on pedestals; the audiotapes on playback machines; and the films 
    in either continuous or special showings. The space requirements for this 
    exhibition would be modest. There should also be a catalogue comparable to 
    that produced by Kostelanetz for the retrospective ~Assembling Assembling~ 
    (1978). This new book would include a brief history of the press, illustrations 
    of exemplary work, reviews, documentation of publications, and other relevant 
    materials. Precisely because The Future Press is so unique, this exhibition 
    would also be unquestionably singular. ~(1983)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~THE PUBLICATION OF &quot;INTERMIX&quot;~</p>
  <p>A constructivist novel of six hundred leaves (twelve hundred pages, by conventional 
    ways of counting), with several sets of narratives of symmetrical abstract 
    drawings that metamorphose, from image to image, in systemic sequence, &quot;Intermix&quot; 
    represents the culmination of a vein of constructivist fiction begun in 1974 
    and already informing two collections of stories, ~Constructs~ (WCPR, 1975) 
    and ~Constructs Two~ (Membrane, 1978), and two novellas in the form of ladderbooks, 
    ~Modulations~ (Assembling, 1975) and ~Extrapolate~ (Cookie, 1975), in addition 
    to one variation with over a hundred loose leaves, ~And So Forth~ (Future, 
    1979), and another novel with 392 images, ~Symmetries~ (forthcoming). All 
    these volumes will eventually be exhibited, as well as sold, together. The 
    cost of photocopying and collating six hundred sheets is $18.00 (@ three cents 
    per sheet); and for two hundred copies the printing costs alone would be $3,600. 
    Binding such books would cost an additional $1,000. The author has produced 
    over a dozen other book-art books of numbers, words, lines and photographs, 
    in formats ranging from conventional spine-book books to sets of cards, tabloid-sized 
    newsprint, and ladderbooks. These books have been exhibited and distributed 
    around the world. ~(1983)~</p>

  <p> We now perceive that we should have reached our theory of the hidden meaning 
    of dreams by the shortest route had we merely consulted the vernacular. Proverbial 
    wisdom, it is true, often speaks contemptuously enough of dreams--it apparently 
    seeks to justify the scientists when it says that &quot;dreams are bubbles&quot;; 
    but in colloquial language the dream is predominently the gracious fulfiller 
    of wishes. &quot;I should never have imagined that in my wildest dreams,&quot; 
    we exclaim in delight if we find that the reality surpasses our expectations.--Sigmund 
    Freud, ~The Interpretation of Dreams~ (1913).</p>
  <p>~BOOK PROPOSAL: &quot;THE GREAT JEWISH CEMETERY OF BERLIN&quot;~</p>
  <p>Many images of prewar Berlin are familiar to us: the lush elegance of Unter 
    den Linden, the grandeur of the Hotel Adlon, the urban spectacle of Potsdamer 
    Platz or Alexanderplatz; but these images survive only in miniature photographs 
    that scarcely represent the grandeur of their subjects. There remains in Berlin 
    today another image of lost Berlin, this less familiar than the others, but 
    no less grand and compelling, with a scale and detail that is more suitable 
    to a reasonably priced book of photographs. That relic is the Great Jewish 
    Cemetery in Weissenssee, a rather inaccessible section of (East) Berlin. First 
    established in 1880, it differs from other Jewish cemeteries in its immense 
    size (over 110,000 graves) and its short history, which gives both firsthand 
    and secondhand experience of the place an epistemological coherence. Here 
    are the gravestones of Jews who lived in Berlin after 1860, when Berlin Jews 
    received full civic equality, when Jews, though never more than 5 percent 
    of the total city population, had such a disproportionate prominence that, 
    to the remainder of Germany, Berlin was known as a Jewish city.</p>
  <p> Choosing to regard this graveyard as the principal surviving representation 
    of a Lost Berlin, I have assembled a book of my photographs, punctuated by 
    short texts, as an exemplary visual history or, to be ironic, modern archaeology. 
    Two of these black-and-white photographs are set on each 6&quot; x 9&quot; 
    page, except when a text supersedes a photograph. The book has a brief preface 
    and will have in the back explanatory footnotes correlated by page numbers 
    to certain individual photographs, adding essential information that might 
    not be apparent in the photographs alone. I also hope to obtain, for an appendix, 
    a complete list of all the individuals buried there, along with their birth 
    dates and death dates (thinking that this would make the book yet more attractive 
    to the descendants of Berliners). All this prose notwithstanding, the unusual 
    presupposition of the book is that the photographs tell most of the story, 
    for in the gravestones we see not only individuals, whose lives are sketched 
    in the data and design of their unusually idiosyncratic stones, but an entire 
    community that, at least until the middle l930s, clearly felt glad to be in 
    Berlin, confident that the city would remain secure for Jews forever. By contrast, 
    the fewer stones laid after l933 and then after l945 tell other sorts of stories.</p>
  <p> Color slides of the cemetery are scheduled to be included in a New York 
    museum exhibition in l984, while a traveling installation of slides and audiotape 
    exclusively about the cemetery is also a future possibility. With the aid 
    of a grant from the Berlin Senat, a German colleague and I are producing a 
    twenty-minute documentary film about this extraordinary place, ~Ein Verlorenes 
    Berlin~, and expect eventually to receive funds to redo this film in other 
    languages of the Berlin diaspora--English, Hebrew, Swedish, Spanish, French 
    and perhaps Portuguese--not only for screenings at festivals and cultural 
    centers but for broadcast over television. We are also completing for RIAS-Berlin 
    a ninety-minute radio documentary (in German) about the cemetery and will 
    be exploring the production of similar documentaries in other languages. The 
    project was begun during my 1981-82 residency in (West) Berlin as a guest 
    of the DAAD Kunstlerprogramm.</p>
  <p> Notwithstanding such interest from other media, this project that began 
    as a book should eventually appear as a book. My first-draft dummy runs over 
    250 pages; my sense is that the final product should have at least 320 pages. 
    Book publishers interested in considering a photocopy of ~The Great Jewish 
    Cemetery of Berlin~, and promising a quick reply, are invited to write me.

  <p>~AN EXHIBITION OF ANTHOLOGIES~</p>
  <p>Over two dozen books of literature, criticism, art and social thought, edited 
    for publishers both large and small--a retrospective of two decades' work--would 
    be put in display cases or, more attractively, left on a supervised table 
    for reading on the premises, in either an art gallery or a library. The display 
    would include ~On Contemporary Literature~ (l964, l969), ~The New American 
    Arts~ (l965), ~Twelve from the Sixties~ (l967), ~The Young American Writers~ 
    (l967), ~Beyond Left &amp; Right~ (l968), ~Imaged Words &amp; Worded Images~ 
    (l970), ~Possibilities of Poetry~ (l970), ~Moholy-Nagy~ (l970), ~John Cage~ 
    (l970), ~Social Speculations~ (l97l), ~Future's Fictions~ (l97l), ~Human Alternatives~ 
    (l97l), ~Seeing Through Shuck~ (l972), ~In Youth~ (l972), ~Breakthrough Fictioneers~ 
    (l973), ~The Edge of Adaptation~ (l973), ~Language &amp; Structure~ (l975), 
    ~Essaying Essays~ (l975), ~Younger Critics in North America~ (l976), ~Esthetics 
    Contemporary~ (l978), ~Assembling Assembling~ (l978), ~Visual Literature Criticism~ 
    (l979), ~Text-Sound Texts~ (l980), ~The Yale Gertrude Stein~ (l980), ~Scenarios~ 
    (l980), ~Aural Literature Criticism~ (l98l) and ~American Writing Today~ (two 
    volumes, l98l). The exhibition should have a catalogue that would open with 
    an expanded version of an autobiographical essay (already drafted for another 
    medium) about the general purposes of these anthologies and then particular 
    histories of individual books. Space permitting, it would perhaps include 
    reproductions of tables of contents, excerpts from introductions and comprehensive 
    bibliographical data. Materials from this catalogue could also be displayed. 
    The exhibition would be the first of its kind, to my knowledge, and would 
    probably be particularly appropriate for libraries with modest exhibition 
    facilities. ~(1983)~</p>

  <p>~DEAR DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC ARTS:~</p>
  <p>Four years ago I received from the Visual Arts Program of the National Endowment 
    for the Arts a Planning Grant for Art in Public Places. Since most of my creative 
    work has been literary, the people awarding me this grant no doubt expected 
    that I would come up with proposals for public art different from the common 
    run. Well, I have. One principal way in which they differ is that most are 
    for extended spaces, such as the edge of a train platform, a series of vaults 
    in a hallway ceiling, the vertical risers of a wide flight of steps, or the 
    floor of a very long passageway, such as that connecting one train line to 
    another or the airline's terminal to the departure pad. Although I once submitted 
    slides of the kinds of images that might fill such spaces, I found that this 
    is less relevant than my declaring in writing, as I am doing now, my preference 
    for such spaces (which most other artists inclined to public art judge impossible) 
    and acknowledging as well that I work within a literary tradition. That last 
    means that I work either with language or literary forms. For the edges of 
    train platforms, for instance, I am proposing the installation, in brass letters 
    at least four inches high, two feet from the edge, their bottoms facing away 
    from the tracks, of texts I call ~strings~. These are extended sequences of 
    letters that are composed of overlapping words, each new word including at 
    least three letters of its predecessor. Let me quote, as an example, the beginning 
    of ~Stringfive~:</p>
  <p>Stringfiveteranciderideafencerebrumblendivestablishmentertainteger|unde<br />
    rwritemperamentorthographysicisternumericalibereavesdropenervous. . . .</p>
  <p>I calculate that, if the letters are four inches high and set lower-case, 
    the exhaustive text (which is a hundred inches long on my typewriter) would 
    be two hundred feet long, which happens to be the length of a typical subway 
    train station. Since these strings, unlike most public art nowadays, cannot 
    be understood in a single glance, they need a captive audience, like people 
    waiting impatiently for a train, willing to work on a puzzle, with full assurance 
    that should they not entirely solve it now, it will surely be there the next 
    time they return. I have already completed six exhaustive texts in this vein--three 
    in English, one in French, one in German and one in Swedish--<br />
    and would like to believe that in a university town or a sophisticated city 
    at least the French and German would not be entirely incomprehensible. One 
    charm of these ~Strings~ is that they are complicated and engrossing enough 
    to survive repeated viewings, especially in public situations where, incidentally, 
    their pedagogic value should not be minimized. For extended passageways and 
    ceilings, I have works I call constructivist fictions which are sequences 
    of square symmetrical abstract line drawings that metamorphose in some sort 
    of systemic narrative and, in contrast to verbal fiction, can be &quot;read&quot; 
    from either end. Some involve only a few successive drawings; others fall 
    into the range of twenty images (and are thus suitable for spaces extended 
    to the ratio of twenty to one); one is nearly four hundred images long (and 
    thus perfect for the driveway to the CIA!). One of these Constructivist Fictions 
    was the finalist in a Portland competition for thirteen ceiling vaults. A 
    final public-art proposal I have is for a film installation of &quot;Epiphanies&quot; 
    ideally in a place where people are waiting against their wishes. It is described 
    in more detail on the enclosed sheet [reprinted below]. Now that I have written 
    this letter, as well as the enclosed proposal, could I please ask you to show 
    both, which may be freely copied, in lieu of slides from me, the next time 
    your council or a similar panel meets to consider artists' ideas for art in 
    public spaces. Naturally, if I pass the first hurdle, I would be willing to 
    make more specific models for more specific sites. If you or your colleagues 
    have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. ~(1983)~</p>

  <p> The real problem now seems to be whether work outside the conventional art-work 
    role may still be regarded as having any chance of remaining within the general 
    category of art-<br />
    work. Does it make sense, as the saying goes, to pick up the ball and run 
    with it ~only~ if everybody thinks one is still playing soccer?<br />
    The main problem with contemporary practical art, it seems to me, is that 
    there's a tendency to overlook that practice is based on rules and that rules 
    are ~prior~ to practice.--Ian Burn/Mel Ramsden, &quot;Some Notes on Practice 
    and Theory&quot; (1969)</p>
  <p>~THE 16 MM FILM &quot;EPIPHANIES&quot;~</p>
  <p>This film, long in progress, contains heightened narrative moments, both 
    visual and verbal--Epiphanies, in the James Joycean sense--that have no ostensible 
    connection to one another, either horizontally (in time) or vertically (in 
    space); for two dimensions of this radical experiment are, first, numerous 
    parts that are identical only in structural kind and, then, a sound track 
    that proceeds independently of the visual (and yet continually complements 
    it esthetically). The sound track contains single-sentence stories I have 
    written and the visual element is drawn from found footage, both color and 
    black-and-white, collected from innumerable sources and edited by me into 
    continuous film that emphasizes the particularity of each visual Epiphany. 
    In its abundance of discrete stories, &quot;Epiphanies&quot; has been (and 
    will be) ultimately concerned with exploring, within the verbal/visual form 
    indigenous to film, the exhaustive experience of the experience of story. 
    The final film should be four hours long, for both continuous showing and 
    an installation in which one hour segments would be projected continuously 
    to four sides of the space (while the separate four-hour sound track is aired 
    continuously). This application requests support for further gathering and 
    editing of found Epiphanies and for further electronic processing and editing 
    of the sound track. After five years of work on &quot;Epiphanies,&quot; I 
    for one would like to see how the complete film turns out; I hope the panel 
    agrees.</p>
  <p> Of &quot;Epiphanies&quot; in progress: A twenty-six-minute version, enclosed 
    with this application, has been screened at Arsenal (Berlin), Literarisches 
    Colloquium Berlin and Donnell Library (N.Y.); a seventy-minute version exists 
    but has not yet been printed; a twenty-minute version with a German soundtrack, 
    commissioned by Sender Freies Berlin as part of its ~Projektionen '83~ series, 
    was broadcast over the North German television network in 1983. Yet more footage 
    has been gathered for future re-edits. Several hours of rough audiotape (in 
    English), with over fifty readers, were produced in 1982 and 1983. Approximately 
    forty-five minutes of this raw material was electronically processed during 
    a two-week residency at WGBH-FM in 1983. Selections of the text have appeared 
    since 1980 in over two dozen American literary magazines and in theatrical 
    productions in 1980 and 1981; a selection in German translation was published 
    as a book in 1983. Another version of &quot;Epiphanies&quot; explores the 
    use of a primitive video character-generator, while a three-minute excerpt 
    toward a full-length opera, written in collaboration with the composer Bruce 
    Kushnick, was accepted for broadcast over Westdeutscher Rundfunk. An exhibition 
    at Albright College (1983) included not only the film and videotape but a 
    wall of small cards, each with a single story.</p>
  <p> Notes on the film &quot;Epiphanies&quot;: Each sentence is meant to be the 
    epiphany, or encompassing climactic moment (in the James Joycean sense), of 
    a longer, nonexistent story. My aim in writing these stories is to make single 
    sentences so evocatively sufficient that the remainder of the story need not 
    be said. Collected together, these stories make a fictional experience that 
    is not linear, but spatial; not sequential, but thoroughly discontinuous; 
    not nineteenth-century, but twentieth-century (though also echoing Homer, 
    whose parataxis Herodotus compared to beads on a string). To me, the author, 
    no story in &quot;Epiphanies&quot; is more important than any other; in context, 
    none is is merely transitional. Another aim was to touch upon the fullest 
    range of human experience, making perhaps the most universal fiction ever 
    written.</p>
  <p> Wishing to extend the principle of Epiphanies into film, I had to decide 
    how such climactic moments could best be made. Since each visual epiphany 
    is meant to stand by itself, absolutely without reference to sequences either 
    before or after (and with no ostensible connection, other than structural 
    similarity, to the different stories on the sound track), I decided it would 
    be best (esthetically, as well as financially and for efficiency) not to shoot 
    fresh footage but to find Epiphanies (perhaps unintentional) in outtakes gathered 
    from many other filmmakers. Had I shot my own footage, I figured, the style 
    of a single cameraman or single director would inevitably impose a consistency 
    that would be utterly contrary to my purpose of making each sequence a distinctly 
    separate entity, as well as contrary to my desire for universality. So, thousands 
    of feet of 16 mm film in a diversity of formats and styles, gathered from 
    the widest variety of sources, were viewed to find the few hundred that I 
    used. The result is, to make two crucial distinctions, not a &quot;compilation 
    film&quot; but a film best made with the compliments of others; and not a 
    film adaptation of a text but a realization in film of unique esthetic principles 
    that likewise inform the text (and, in point of fact, precede it).</p>
  <p> The work is so various and abundant that people viewing it tend to come 
    away with (1) a sense of the whole and (2) moments, either verbal or visual, 
    that particularly appeal to them. In my experience, everyone has his or her 
    own favorites, usually for personal reasons (and whether these favorites are 
    visual or verbal often indicates much about his or her perceptual outlook). 
    Whereas another film also made with Martin Koerber, ~Ein Verlorenes Berlin~, 
    has a particular theme that, even if it is not told, must be communicated 
    for the film to succeed, &quot;Epiphanies&quot; is so expansively open that 
    I can expect no more than the reception of its esthetic theme: ~the exhaustive 
    experience of the experience of story~. Everything else any viewer takes away 
    is, literally, his or her own to possess (and beyond my design).</p>
  <p> Several people who have seen the same version-in-progress twice have asked 
    me if the &quot;second film differed from the first.&quot; This indicates 
    not any trickery on my part but a quality peculiar to &quot;Epiphanies&quot;: 
    A film so rich in discrete parts simply cannot be assimilated thoroughly in 
    a single sitting. As the film becomes longer, and yet more various, it will 
    become yet more impossible to view fully in the conventional way--perhaps 
    not even in several sittings! With this problem in mind, let me suggest that 
    &quot;Epiphanies&quot; is best seen in venues where members of the audience 
    can enter and leave as they wished, confident that they can return at any 
    point without difficulty. While they may, it is true, have missed certain 
    episodes, they would not upon their return in any sense feel lost. In that 
    case it would be more appropriate to show the film continuously in situations 
    where viewers could stay as long as they liked. There would be no starting 
    time other than the opening of the projection and no closing time other than 
    turning off the lights. (This is politically agreeable to someone like myself 
    who dislikes the convention of forcing an audience to seat themselves at a 
    certain time, not to arise until another time.) </p>
  <p> The further I get into this film, the more I find it differs from 99.9 percent 
    of the films ever made, not just because its parts are so disconnected (whereas 
    most films aim for continuity) or because its sound track does not-- and need 
    not--synchronize with the visual track, but in the kind of alternative cinematic 
    experience it offers. Yet in spite of these conceptual differences and its 
    unusual origins, &quot;Epiphanies&quot; is still very much about exploiting 
    (and exploring) possibilities unique to the medium of film. ~(1983)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p> I have a spiteful motive in writing such a book in the present climate of 
    society. It is to establish that if you do not do better, it is not because 
    there are no alternatives, but because you do not choose to. . . . Our problems 
    are not technological and sociological; they are moral and political.--Paul 
    Goodman, ~Utopian Essays and Practical Proposals~ (1962)</p>
  <p>~A SPEECH-MUSIC &quot;KADDISH&quot; FOR RADIO~</p>
  <p>In an earlier work, ~Invocations~ (1981), I mixed the prayers of over sixty 
    ministers from different faiths, speaking over two dozen languages, into a 
    work of art about the sound of the language of prayer. By contrast, the proposed 
    &quot;Kaddish&quot; will focus upon a single prayer that is spoken in a great 
    variety of styles and accents. A prayer for the dead that exists only in Aramaic 
    (and differs from others of its kind in not mentioning death), the Kaddish 
    is also the most poetic statement in the Jewish liturgy. The following rough 
    English transliteration of one system of pronunciation gives some sense of 
    its special sacred sound:</p>
  <p>Yisgadal v'yiskadash sh'me rabbo, b'olmo deevro chiruseh v'yamlick malchuseh, 
    b'chayechon uvyomechon, uv'chayey d'chol beys yisroel, baagolo uvizman koreev, 
    v'imrue omen. Y'he sh-meh rabbo m'vorach l'loam ulolmay olmayo. Yisborach 
    v'yistabch v'yispo-ar v'yrisroman v'yisnaseh v'yis-hador v'yisaley v'yishallol 
    sh-meh d'kukdsho b'reech hu l-elo min col birchoso v'shiroso tuscho'choso 
    v'nechemoso daamiron b'olmo v'imru omen. Y'he sh'lomo rabbo min sh'mayo v'chayim 
    olenu v'al col yisroel, v'imru omen. Oseh sholom bimromov, hu yaaseh sholom 
    olenu v'al col yisroel v'imru omen.</p>
  <p>[The best translation known to me is: Magnified and sanctified be his great 
    Name in the world which he hath created according to his will. May he establish 
    his kingdom during your life and during your days, and during the life of 
    all the house of Israel, even speedily and at a near time, and say ye, Amen. 
    Let his great Name be blessed forever and to all eternity. Blessed, praised 
    and glorified, exalted, extolled and honored, magnified and lauded be the 
    Name of the Holy One, blessed be he; though he be high above all the blessings 
    and hymns, praises and consultations, which are uttered in the world; and 
    say ye, Amen. May there be abundant peace from heaven, and life for us and 
    for all Israel; and say ye, Amen. He who makest peace in his high places, 
    may he make peace for us and for all Israel; and say ye, Amen.]</p>
  <p> The plan is to collect readings of this traditional text from ministers 
    and cantors around the world, the sounds of their voices implicitly representing 
    the scope of the Diaspora. Here, as in ~Invocations~, I prefer recording religious 
    professionals, because not only do they say the prayer accurately, they have 
    more experience at articulating the nuances of every phrase. Therefore, it 
    is requested that each radio station interested in the work please endeavor 
    to record local rabbis and cantors. These readings will then be mixed into 
    duets, choruses, fugues, and successive solos, in the tradition of ~Invocations~ 
    and the ~Eight Nights of Hanukah~ produced for the CBC in 1983. My &quot;Kaddish&quot; 
    will be produced, funding permitting, in 1985, at a length between forty and 
    sixty minutes (with excerpting probably feasible), ideally for broadcast on 
    or around Yom Kippur 1985. Radio directors seriously interested in coproducing 
    the work, or in auditing either of its predecessors, are advised to contact 
    me. ~(1983)~.</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~MODULAR AUDIO &quot;EPIPHANIES&quot;~</p>
  <p>~Background~: &quot;Epiphanies&quot; is a collection of over two thousand 
    single-sentence stories that have been published in both literary journals 
    and an anthology of theatrical ~Scenarios~ (1980). They also became the text 
    of both a performance piece and a character-generated videotape. In German 
    translation, selections from the text were published as a book; other parts 
    became the sound track of a film shown on the North German television network. 
    Back in America, over a thousand of these stories were recorded by thirty-five 
    readers at WBAI-FM, New York, in February 1982, and then several hundred more 
    were recorded at WGBH-FM, Boston, in January 1983, for editing into a single 
    uninterrupted program at least four hours long. In James Joyce's theory of 
    the short story, we remember, the epiphany is the encompassing climactic moment 
    that functions to illuminate the entire story. In my &quot;Epiphanies&quot; 
    I have tried to suggest the same momentous quality within a single sentence 
    that is, hopefully, so evocatively sufficient that the remainder of the story 
    need not be said. As no story is intentionally related to any other, the experience 
    of a succession of them is necessarily discontinuous--not nineteenth-century, 
    but twentieth. In time-based media, where the Epiphanies come at a moderate 
    pace, listeners tend to remember what suits their taste and experience, as 
    well as assimilate another quality I take to be the principal theme of the 
    work as a whole: ~the exhaustive experience of the experience of story~.</p>
  <p>~Foreground~: What is proposed is a different use of this taped material. 
    As the stories can be heard in any order, the long tape can thus also be divided 
    and distributed into a large number of short programs--at least fifty, perhaps 
    as many as one hundred--that range in length from twenty seconds to a few 
    minutes. Distributed over the satellite, these brief programs could then be 
    spontaneously inserted, in any order, at available lengths, into the empty 
    spaces of each station's programming. (They are better than most promos and, 
    better yet, would sustain interest in promos if interspersed between.) In 
    an individual station's programming, &quot;Epiphanies&quot; should appear 
    as a continuous unscheduled feature--each program a surprise that should nonetheless 
    refer to others. The initial constraint for me as the author/producer is to 
    separate the individual stories--no story should sound connected to any other. 
    Thus, in addition to using a great number of readers with distinctive voices, 
    I have been using audio processing to give each story its own setting, so 
    to speak. Approximately thirty-five minutes of material were processed to 
    my satisfaction during a sixty-hour guest residency at WGBH-FM in Boston in 
    1983. I shall need to process a few hours more before this is done (and the 
    whole can be cut apart). Since variety is key, the plan is to use various 
    technologies in several studios. These &quot;Epiphanies&quot; will initially 
    be distributed over a satellite system as a continuous program, with the segments 
    prefaced by a voice announcing the length (which will aid in cuing) and then 
    the suffix, &quot;Those were &quot;Epiphanies&quot; by Richard Kostelanetz.&quot; 
    From time to time there will be a longer credit to its benefactors.</p>
  <p> This is not the sort of program that commercial radio would ever want to 
    do (since it cannot be sponsored), and there is no mechanism known to me for 
    either producing or distributing it at National Public Radio at present. By 
    contrast, were it made available gratis to independent stations, it could 
    be easily plugged into the available open spaces in the imprecise programming 
    formats that customarily allow announcers and engineers to improvise within 
    an overall structure. ~(1983)~</p>

  <p>~&quot;WORDSAND&quot;: A TRAVELING EXHIBITION~</p>
  <p>A traveling exhibition of my creative work with language in several media, 
    ~Wordsand~ presently includes spine-bound books of my visual poetry, visual 
    fiction, experimental prose and numerical art; ladderbooks of visual fiction; 
    card books whose pages can be distributed over an exhibition space; silk-screened 
    prints; a poem on adding machine tape over fifty feet long; offset cards; 
    stereoaudiotapes; color videotapes; 16 mm sound films; and a hologram. The 
    spine-bound books have customarily been placed on an open shelf adjacent to 
    a comfortable chair. The ladderbooks have been strung out over the display 
    space. The card books can be mounted on walls, along with the prints. The 
    cassettes of audiotapes and videotapes can be played whenever visitors wish. 
    The film can likewise be shown on demand or at scheduled times. A holographic 
    film is available, if the host already has (or can arrange to borrow) a clear 
    cylinder 16&quot; in diameter, a circular projection stand, and appropriate 
    installation know-how. The exhibition has been installed in a space 100' x 
    20', in two adjacent rooms roughly 20' x 30', within a single space 35' square 
    divided by thin screens and within a space 20' x 50' punctuated by a pillar. 
    Only the sixteen large prints need be framed; they are already matted. All 
    the materials fit into a single crate 46&quot; x 30&quot; x 9&quot; that weighs 
    roughly ninety pounds, and it has so far gone, mostly by &quot;package express&quot; 
    (bus), to Simon Fraser University, University of Alberta, Cornell College 
    (Iowa), University of North Dakota, Miami-Dade Community College, Vassar College, 
    and California State University at Bakersfield. The Gallery at Simon Fraser 
    copublished a ninety-two-page catalogue that is filled not with illustrations 
    but with theoretical and art-autobiographical writings. Even though I would 
    like to do a larger illustrated catalogue before long, I can supply copies 
    of this first edition to retail at three dollars apiece. It appears that ~Wordsand~ 
    may well be the first comprehensive one-person exhibition of its particular 
    literary-artistic kind in America.</p>
  <p>The following materials are available for the ~Wordsand~ exhibition:</p>
  <p>~Word Prints~, seven silk-screened prints, nonsequential, 26&quot; x 40&quot; 
    each.<br />
    ~Echo~, one silkcreened print, 23&quot; x 29&quot;.<br />
    ~Numbers One~, six prints, 22&quot; x 30&quot;, only two of which must be 
    displayed together.<br />
    ~Modulations~ and ~Extrapolate~, two ladderbooks, each roughly 4&quot; x 80&quot;, 
    to be mounted vertically on a wall.<br />
    Posters &amp; cards: Manifestoes, Radar, Autobiography, Combinations, Echo, 
    Metamorphosis, Evolving, Milestones in a Life.<br />
    Loose-leaf books: ~Numbers One~ (seven images), ~Rain Rains Rain~ (twenty-four 
    cards)<br />

  <p>Even though I was an Artist in Residence last year, please hear me out. It 
    took me a while to discover what your Fairlight CMI could do best with speech--<br />
    how I, as a language artist, could best exploit the new machine's extraordinary 
    potentials, within its severe limitations; and while I was more than pleased 
    with what I did with your technician last summer, I'd like please to request 
    another free pass at the system. My experience tells me that, given that it 
    can handle units no longer than four seconds, the Fairlight works best with 
    individuals words. In my first foray at the Fairlight, I used the German words 
    for yes, no and sure. A future piece would consist of collections of related 
    words, such as these:</p>
  <p> Kill, Slay, Hang, Massacre, Bump Off, Choke, Drown, Murder, Execute, Smother, 
    Decimate, Strangle, Immolate, Slaughter, Incinerate, Snuff Out, Asphyxiate, 
    Exterminate, Assassinate, Put to Death, etc.</p>
  <p>Or:</p>
  <p> Live, Arise, Thrive, Vivify, Prevail, Endure, Subsist, Animate, Breathe, 
    Turn On, Continue, Activate, Energize, Propagate, Invigorate, Resuscitate, 
    Walk the Earth, etc.</p>
  <p>These words would then be enhanced and combined in various ways, ideally 
    creating a linguistic synergy that exceeds the impact of any individual word.</p>
  <p> Another possibility would involve using a collection of Hebrew religious 
    imperatives. </p>
  <p> Both works extend my esthetic desire to do on audiotape language constructions 
    that cannot be done live, to create language experiences radically different 
    from anything heard or read before. In the course of producing these pieces, 
    I would also like to explore the studio's other technologies for their possibilities 
    in speech modification. ~(1983)~</p>

  <p>~AN EXHIBITION OF FICTIONS~</p>
  <p>Richard Kostelanetz has for the past fifteen years worked in a variety of 
    formats unusual for fiction, including newsprint books, ladderbooks, non-sequential 
    cards, mostly blank books, audio, video and film, with a variety of unusual 
    fictional materials, including single-sentence stories, fictions with only 
    one or two words to a paragraph, stories composed exclusively of numbers and 
    of line drawings. On the walls will be mounted several hundred cards of single-sentence 
    ~Epiphanies~, a frieze of ~Openings &amp; Closings~, the large-format newsprint 
    stories (&quot;Milestones in a Life,&quot; certain numerical fictions), the 
    ladderbooks (~Modulations~ &amp; ~Extrapolate~) and the original drawings/versions 
    of some of the abstract stories. Rare and fragile fictions (~Tabula Rasa~, 
    ~Inexistences~, ~Obliterate~) will be under glass, their pages open to reveal 
    their contents. More common books will be on a table, available for reading 
    on the premises: ~Short Fictions~, ~In the Beginning~, ~Numbers: Poems &amp; 
    Stories~, ~One Night Stood~ (in both editions), ~Constructs~, ~Constructs 
    Two~, ~More Short Fictions~, ~Come Here~, ~Foreshortenings~, the German edition 
    of ~Epiphanies~, ~Openings &amp; Closings~, ~And So Forth~, ~Exhaustive Parallel 
    Intervals~, ~Reincarnations~. The audiotapes of fiction (~Experimental Prose~, 
    ~Monotapes~, ~Openings &amp; Closings~, ~Foreshortenings~, ~Epiphanies~, ~Seductions~, 
    ~Conversations~, ~Dialogues~) should be available from the attendant, to be 
    played in a stereo cassette player (with earphones) whenever a spectator wants 
    to hear one. The same procedure should govern the exhibition of creative videotapes 
    (~Openings &amp; Closings~, ~Three Prose Pieces~, ~Epiphanies~) which can 
    include videocopies of both theatrical performances of ~Epiphanies~ and the 
    four films based on fictions: ~Constructivist Fictions~, ~Openings &amp; Closings~ 
    and two completely different versions of the film ~Epiphanies~ that are in 
    turn completely different from the theatrical and video versions, and utterly 
    different from each other as well, one having a German sound track, the other 
    an English sound track. In a separate place, for reference, could be the artist's 
    three anthologies of fiction--~Twelve from the Sixties~ (1967), ~Future's 
    Fictions~ (1971), ~Breakthrough Fictioneers~ (1973)-<br />
    -and, if published in time, a book of the author's essays on fiction. The 
    exhibition should include a catalogue itemizing the work and relating it to 
    other developments in contemporary art and the traditions of fiction. ~(1984)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~A SERIES OF PROGRAMS ON AMERICAN HORSPIEL~</p>
  <p>As we approach the sixtieth anniversary of American radio drama, I would 
    like to propose a series of twenty-six programs, each one hour long, devoted 
    to the ~American Tradition of Horspiel~. Here, as elsewhere, I prefer to use 
    the German term which means, literally, hear-play, because it includes so 
    much more than the English-language equivalent of &quot;radio drama&quot; 
    (but drop the original's umlaut, because I want to Americanize the word). 
    All the works I wish to include are available on transcriptions, most of them 
    scarce. This series would open with Archibald MacLeish's ~Fall of the City~ 
    (l937), which remains a milestone to us all (and incidentally his greatest 
    single work in this genre); but from there we would differ from any other 
    series that might likewise start with MacLeish in concentrating upon the more 
    ~radiophonic~ North American works. By &quot;radiophonic&quot; I mean those 
    pieces that successfully exploit the unique acoustic possibilities of radio, 
    to realize stories and experiences that could succeed only on radio, my theme 
    being that in this age when film and television predominate, radio works best 
    when it does what the other media cannot do--not when it attempts to re-create 
    the situation or even the illusion of live theater but when it realizes experiences 
    that can exist only in the ear. From the classic period, we will play such 
    works as Orson Welles's ~War of the Worlds~ (l938), Lucille Fletcher's ~Sorry, 
    Wrong Number~, Norman Corwin's ~Daybreak~ and Kenneth Patchen's ~He Wears 
    a Slouch Hat~. Since I have suggested elsewhere (most recently in a program 
    for Westdeutscher Rundfunk) that the greatest American radio theater of the 
    prewar years appeared in radio comedy, we will feature, for one program apiece, 
    several major figures from this period, including Amos 'n Andy, Jack Benny, 
    Fibber McGee and Molly, George Burns and Gracie Allen, the Easy Aces and Fred 
    Allen. Here we will play both whole programs and choice excerpts, depending 
    upon what is available and how much commentary is necessary. The contemporary 
    (post-1950) period will include excerpts from Stan Freberg, Nichols and May, 
    Cheech &amp; Chong, John Cage's ~Roaratorio~, the Firesign Theater's ~Do Anything 
    You Want To~ and selections from Bob &amp; Ray, among others. I would edit 
    the programs and also write the brief commentaries. If the series successfully 
    develops a positive reputation, the whole cycle could be repeated; ideally, 
    it could also provide the sponsoring station with a foundation for fresh productions 
    of American horspiel. ~(1984)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p> When art does not any longer depend upon its physical presence, when it 
    becomes an abstraction, it is not distorted and altered by its reproduction 
    in books. It becomes &quot;PRIMARY&quot; information, while the reproduction 
    of conventional art in books and catalogues is necessarily (distorted) &quot;SECONDARY&quot; 
    information. When information is PRIMARY, the catalogue can become the exhibition.--Seth 
    Siegelaub (1969), as quoted in Ursula Meyer, ~Conceptual Art~ (1972)</p>
  <p>~THE SOUND OF GERMAN/AMERICAN POETRY IN AMERICA/GERMANY~</p>
  <p>What I propose to do is record at least two dozen native-born Americans reciting 
    a favorite German poem of their choice, and to compose from these readings 
    an interwoven, multitrack piece ostensibly about ~the sound~ of German poetry 
    in America. I would choose readers whose competence in German was various, 
    from a friend with her baby jingle to Americans who frequently travel in Germany. 
    My sense is that the work would be comic, sure, not only about the sound and 
    rhythms of English colliding with the acoustic qualities of German, but I 
    hope the piece will get into much else, including the profound differences 
    between two languages with similar roots. I would do the original recordings 
    here and there, but would in the composing need to work with a German writer 
    whose love of language comedy equaled my own. (There are several possible 
    collaborators in mind.)</p>
  <p> There should also be a companion about ~The Sound of American Poetry in 
    Germany~. This would be composed in similar ways from literate Germans reading 
    their favorite American poems.</p>
  <p> My preliminary calculations are that these are two separate pieces, each 
    roughly thirty minutes in length, which could be broadcast separately or sequentially. 
    It might also be interesting to try to compose a single piece incorporating 
    both sets of readings, but I am less sure about what the result of that would 
    be (or whether it would be as successful). My expectation is that the principal 
    producer of this project will be a German station. If it were coproduced by 
    an American organization, certain expenses could easily be shared. The compositional 
    work will probably be done at the Electronic Music Studio of Stockholm, where 
    I have worked several times before. ~(1984)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~POSSIBILITIES OF LONGER POETRY: AN ANTHOLOGY OF AMERICAN CONTEMPORARIES~</p>
  <p>This aims to be a diversified collection of important post-1959 long poems 
    (integral wholes, rather than collections of parts, over ten pages in length, 
    but shorter than a whole book), along with an extended historical-critical 
    introduction to recent longer poetry, the requisite bio-bibliographical notes, 
    and a selective bibliography, after the model of my earlier ~Possibilities 
    of Poetry~ (Delta, 1970), whose introduction was reprinted, among other places, 
    in my ~The Old Poetries and the New~ (University of Michigan, 1981). My theme 
    here, as before, is that postwar poetry represents a series of reactions to 
    the post-Eliot hegemony of 1945, and that these reactions have been so various 
    that it is fair to speak of this recent period as, first of all, unprecedentedly 
    plural. The length of the book ultimately depends upon the publisher's budget 
    (with 320 pages as minimum), and the following selections are tentative, in 
    part because all material will be reexamined and the advice of colleagues 
    solicited, especially about options that have recently appeared, but mostly 
    because all possible contributors will be offered the following terms of payment: 
    as two thirds of the publishers' entire advance to the editor be allocated 
    to the contributors upon publication, that sum will be divided by the number 
    of pages in the book to reach the basic per-page rate, with each contributor 
    receiving this amount multiplied by the number of printed pages of his or 
    her selection, without exception. Those poems whose authors/publishers cannot 
    accept these equitable terms will simply be listed in an appendix for readers 
    to find on their own.</p>

  <p>~A COLLABORATION WITH POLYARTIST FRANCIS SCHWARTZ~</p>
  <p>We would like to produce a polyartistic, polyglot, evening-length theatrical 
    work (or contemporary &quot;opera&quot;) utilizing instrumental sound, olfactory 
    stimulation, video, climatic manipulation, electronically generated sound, 
    speech collage, monologues and spatial effects. Thematically, the material 
    will derive from ancient Jewish themes and their subsequent presence in both 
    Christian and Islamic liturgies and commentaries (e.g., parallels and extensions 
    of the Song of Songs on one hand and the Book of Job on the other). Given 
    the ecumenically sacred nature of this piece, it could be presented on the 
    occasion of a consequential date in the religious calendar of any of the three 
    religions; it could be presented as well in spaces other than formal concert 
    halls. We plan to incorporate not only techniques but excerpts from previous 
    works of ours, such as Kostelanetz's ~Invocations~ (1981) or Schwartz's ~Caligula~ 
    (1975), among others. Kostelanetz will be particularly responsible for language 
    and media, Schwartz for music and theater. Schwartz has composed extended 
    musical/theatrical works, Kostelanetz evening-length tape works. Not only 
    has each worked in the other's domains, but we have known each other for over 
    a decade and have worked together before. Remembering that religious services 
    at their highest have always been overwhelming multimedia experiences, we 
    think that the work we propose to do will be profoundly traditional in feeling 
    and thoroughly contemporary in expression. While we particularly envision 
    a live production, radio-record or television-videotape versions will also 
    be feasible. Should any producers seriously interested in our vision have 
    any further questions, please contact either of us--Kostelanetz in English, 
    Schwartz at the University of Puerto Rico in English, Spanish or French. ~(1984)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p> One can see in some of his applications for Guggenheim fellowships (he never 
    got one) that he usually had a good idea of what he was trying to create and 
    how to go about it, and if one looks closely his plans are seen to grow out 
    of some already realized work, the analysis of which has determined the next 
    step. It is therefore a little unsettling to read rapidly through these fellowship 
    applications--1942, 1943, 1945, 1946, 1947--for the career unfolds too fast, 
    novels and plays conceived, brought forth (midwife or not) and autopsied, 
    like animated cartoons. Perhaps this haste was anxiety, the result of having 
    no audience to justify his art.--Taylor Stoehr, introduction to ~Creator Spirit 
    Come: The Literary Essays of Paul Goodman~ (1977)</p>
  <p>~THE AUTOMATED PEN~, A BOOK ON WORD PROCESSING FOR WRITERS</p>
  <p>This will differ from guidebooks already popular, such as Peter McWilliams's 
    ~Word Processing Handbook~, in concentrating not upon differences in machinery 
    but upon the various word-processing programs which my colleagues and I will 
    discuss critically from the perspective of their capabilities and accessibility 
    for ~writing~ everything from letters to books. One truth that seems to be 
    lost in current advice is that while all the new machines have advantages 
    over typewriters, not only do they do different things, but even the same 
    tasks are often done differently. For instance, in evaluating some of the 
    popular cheaper systems, we will show precisely why their programs, though 
    useful for writing neat business letters, are not good for writing long essays 
    or books.</p>
  <p> In discussing the more sophisticated programs, such as those available for 
    the IBM-PC, we will evaluate and contrast the differences in printing options 
    and, say, physical manipulations, for instance separating those that use the 
    function keys excessively from those that use them scarcely. We will analyze 
    such supplements as Word Plus and Grammatik as well the genuine advantages 
    of an expensive &quot;dedicated&quot; word processor, if only to show what 
    is ultimately feasible in word processing with computers. We shall not ignore 
    machines other than the IBM; but since our thesis is that no single program 
    is always best--they just have different capabilities for writing--our general 
    advice about machines is that you should purchase that which best operates 
    the program that best suits your writing needs. If, for instance, you prefer 
    the operational style of the Spellbinder program, the Eagle is probably best; 
    but if you want to do a footnoted text and to split your screen horizontally 
    with, say, your outline in the top part and your work area in the bottom, 
    you should consider a machine sympathetic to programs with split-screen capabilities. 
    Should you want to use programs that allow you to write in the different alphabets 
    of foreign languages, another machine would be best. And so on.</p>
  <p> We expect that our commentary will be sophisticated and discriminating, 
    in the tradition of McWilliams, who gains the reader's trust through his critical-advisory 
    style. One of us is a professional writer who has authored over twenty books 
    and incidentally advised many colleagues about word processing; his partner 
    has worked for several years in the technical writing department of a computer 
    installation and is thus accustomed to explaining technical procedures to 
    laymen. If this book were contracted now, we would expect to deliver within 
    a year computer disks ready for typesetting a 256-page book. ~(1984)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~FILMING &quot;NEW YORK CITY&quot;~</p>
  <p>~New York City~ is an extended 140-minute audiotape composed of sounds both 
    typical and unique to New York City, which were then mixed together not to 
    create scenes but to reveal acoustic qualities and audio experience. It was 
    commissioned by the HÃ¶rspiel (radio play) department of Westdeutscher Rundfunk 
    for broadcast in 1984 in its ~Metropolis~ series (which also includes Pierre 
    Henry's Paris and two 1930 radio pieces about Berlin by Walter Ruttmann and 
    Alfred Doblin). What is proposed here, in a reversal of convention, is basing 
    a film on this sound track. As the tape is composed of sounds unique to New 
    York, so the footage would be of images likewise unique. To capture the variousness 
    of the city, it would be better, I think, if this footage were shot not just 
    by me, but by others as well. Colleagues would be asked for their outtakes, 
    while I would offer advanced New York City film students 16 mm stock, in exchange 
    for credit in the film (and payment for footage actually used). The latter, 
    especially, would be encouraged to shoot extended sequences, as many sections 
    of the tape run over five minutes. This footage would be edited, and sometimes 
    superimposed, by me, at times to accompany the film track explicitly, other 
    times to complement it with parallel impressions. This procedure for producing 
    the film ~New York City~ resembles what I am doing, with some success, in 
    my film &quot;Epiphanies&quot; (in progress since 1981), which was likewise 
    composed from footage shot by others. Behind the idea of the film stands the 
    main principle of my current creative work, which is realizing in a new medium 
    what began in another (mostly audiotapes from texts, but also, in the case 
    of &quot;Epiphanies,&quot; exhibition cards, audiotape, videotape and film, 
    all from a text). Another form for my audio ~New York City~ would be a concert 
    presentation with thousands of slides; but one advantage of film, it seems 
    to me, is that its images are kinetic, as my sounds as kinetic. (A second 
    advantage is that film is potentially a mass medium, while concerts are not.) 
    Oddly, the only earlier example known to me of a radio play that became a 
    film was also the initial model for my own hometown portrait--Dylan Thomas's 
    ~Under Milk Wood~. ~(1984)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p> In the center of Fedora, that gray stone metropolis, stands a metal building 
    with a crystal globe in every room. Looking into each globe, you see a blue 
    city, the model of a different Fedora. These are the forms the city could 
    have taken if, for one reason for another, it had not become what we see today. 
    In every age someone, looking at Fedora as it was, imagined a way of making 
    it the ideal city, but while he constructed his miniature model, Fedora was 
    already no longer the same as before, and what had been until yesterday a 
    possible future became only a toy in a glass globe.--Italo Calvino, ~Invisible 
    Cities~ (1972)</p>
  <p>MODEST EDITIONS OF UNPUBLISHED BOOK-ART BOOKS</p>
  <p>For the past decade Richard Kostelanetz has been working on several book-art 
    dummies that have not been funded in the past and are probably not going to 
    be funded anywhere else, including &quot;Intermix&quot; (interwoven sequences 
    of drawings, several hundred pages long), &quot;Symmetries&quot; (a visual 
    novel with 392 line drawings, to be produced in a ninety-six-page format 4&quot; 
    high x 14&quot; wide), &quot;Recall&quot; (based upon systematic recompositions 
    of a classic symmetrical photograph of the Brooklyn Bridge), &quot;Relationships&quot; 
    (in a scroll several feet long), &quot;More Numbers&quot; (in a conventional 
    saddle-stitched format), and ~Prose Pieces~ (nonsyntactic writing, also for 
    a more conventional format), all of which are/will be written/drawn and produced 
    by the artist.</p>
  <p> Richard Kostelanetz has authored and produced over a dozen book-art books, 
    in a variety of formats ranging from conventional spine-bound books of drawings, 
    words, photographs and numerical arrays to ladderbooks, newsprint books, two-front 
    books, loose-leaf books, card books and much else, which have been distributed 
    through Jaap Rietman, Printed Matter and other choice outlets. There have 
    been several one-person exhibitions of his book art in New York and elsewhere, 
    and his book-art books have been incorporated into ~Wordsand~, a traveling 
    retrospective of his work with words, numbers and lines in several media. 
    In the theoretical discussions about &quot;Artists' Books,&quot; he has stood 
    for the position that evidence of esthetic consideration of the medium is 
    more important than the biography of the author and thus that the term ~Book-Art 
    Books~ is more appropriate than the more familiar epithet. ~(1984)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>&quot;EPIPHANIES&quot;: AN OPERA<br />
    ~Epiphanies~ began as Richard Kostelanetz's text of single-sentence stories 
    that are epiphanies in the Joycean sense. Some of them have appeared in American 
    literary magazines; a selection, translated into German, appeared as a book 
    in 1983. Fifty voices were recorded, reading most of these stories, for a 
    long radio play whose production (i.e., audio processing) is still in progress. 
    The stories also became the sound track for a film whose visual element was 
    composed of cinematic epiphanies gathered from other filmmakers' footage. 
    A version of this film, with a German sound track, was broadcast over the 
    North German Television network in 1983. There is also a theatrical version 
    of the text that has been produced both at Vassar College and University of 
    North Dakota (in remarkably different productions). A video ~Epiphanies~, 
    composed exclusively on a character-generator, also exists.</p>
  <p> What is proposed here is an operatic realization of the enclosed text with 
    music by Bruce Kushnick. As can be observed on the sample audiotape, some 
    of the stories are read alone, while others are set to music; in yet other 
    passages is music alone with a similarly epiphanic quality. Changes in media 
    notwithstanding, there is an overall effort to make each event stand by itself, 
    distinct from all the others. As author-composers, Kushnick and I expect to 
    provide elements of written text and sound scores (and tapes) that can be 
    selected and assembled to the director's taste and then distributed among 
    available performers. (With neither sound nor text need all our elements be 
    used.) We look forward to interpretations that are radically different from 
    one another, and very much regard our work as a sort of outline offering performance 
    opportunities beyond our own imaginations. The enclosed audiotape sample we 
    have so far produced was accepted for broadcast, as is, by the ~HÃ¶rspiel~ 
    (radio play) department of Westdeutscher Rundfunk in Cologne. Should anyone 
    considering our proposal have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask.

  <p>~A NEW, EXPANDED EDITION OF~ MASTER MINDS</p>
  <p>~Master Minds~ (1969) is a book of my long comprehensive profiles, mostly 
    from the ~New York Times Magazine~, of major American artists and intellectuals, 
    including Marshall McLuhan, Herman Kahn, Glenn Gould, Allen Ginsberg, Paul 
    Goodman, Ralph Ellison, Reinhold Niebuhr, John Cage, Milton Babbitt, and Robert 
    Rauschenberg, among others. In these pieces, I have tried to introduce first-rank 
    intellectual and artistic achievements in terms comprehensible to laymen and 
    then to show how such work reflects its authors. Since cultural achievement 
    is the source of my interest, these profiles are mostly sympathetic, though 
    scarcely uncritical. People familiar with my writing tend to judge them as 
    my most popular (or incipiently popular) prose. Nonetheless, when ~Master 
    Minds~ first appeared in 1969, its publisher was administratively disintegrating; 
    and even though the book was scarcely advertised and never reprinted, it was 
    kept in print for a dozen years before its copyright was returned to me. In 
    the meantime I have done similarly extended profiles of other seminal figures, 
    including Kenneth Burke, Edwin Land (the Polaroid chief), Noam Chomsky, Northrop 
    Frye, Robert Wilson, Hannah Arendt, Merce Cunningham, John Ashbery, and B. 
    B. King, among others.</p>
  <p> What I propose now is a new edition of ~Master Minds~ that would include 
    these new pieces, revised for their inclusion here. (If these can be set in 
    type identical to that of the original book, the earlier chapters need not 
    be reset.) I would like to think that this new ~Master Minds~ not only would 
    attract literate general readers; especially in paperback, it would also be 
    used in courses devoted to intellectual history and contemporary studies. 
    Any editor seriously wishing to consider the original volume, along with the 
    new pieces, is advised to contact me. ~(1984)~</p>

  <p>~FURTHER WORK IN THE PRODUCTION OF &quot;AUDIO WRITING&quot;~</p>
  <p>Including:</p>
  <p>1. An Audioautobiography, probably sixty minutes long.</p>
  <p>2. A series of sixty-minute pieces about the sounds of American poetry as 
    spoken by individuals whose mother tongue is German, Swedish, French or Italian, 
    and the sounds of familiar poems in those languages spoken by native Americans, 
    produced in collaboration with audio colleagues native to those other languages.</p>
  <p>3. The completion of &quot;Epiphanies,&quot; in progress since 1982, to be 
    at least four hours long as a continuous piece, but probably also divided 
    into sets of shorter programs for wider distribution.</p>
  <p>4. The beginning of &quot;Epiphanies&quot; in German and Spanish, produced 
    with the cooperation respectively of the DAAD Berliner Kunstlerprogramm and 
    the University of Puerto Rico. </p>
  <p>5. The completion of &quot;Constellations,&quot; in progress since 1979, 
    in which groups of words that relate in various ways interact in various ways 
    in acoustic space.</p>
  <p>6. &quot;Kaddish&quot;: Whereas ~Invocations~ brought into a single acoustic 
    space the various prayers of sixty ministers, in over two dozen languages, 
    this hour-long piece, requiring (like its predecessor) several weeks of field 
    recordings, will mix on a multitrack tape machine the various versions and 
    accents of a single text</p>
  <p>7. The exploration of further work with sacred texts, especially at the Electronic 
    Music Studio of Stockholm and the studios of both Westdeutscher Rundfunk and 
    the Brooklyn College Center for Computer Music.</p>
  <p>8. Two sixty-minute audio montages, one in English, the other in French, 
    about Jewish life in Berlin prior to WWII, to be composed from excerpts from 
    long interviews made for the film ~Ein Verlorenes Berlin~ (l983) and its successors.</p>
  <p>9. The completion and preparation for publication of &quot;Texts &amp; Proposals 
    for Radio,&quot; in progress since 1981, which would be the first American 
    book of a single practitioner's ideas for and about alternative radio. ~(1984)~</p>

  <p>~AN ENGLISH EDITION OF A GERMAN BOOK~</p>
  <p>~American Imaginations~, a collection of my writings on American avant-garde 
    artists, was published in Berlin by Merveverlag in 1983; all other rights 
    to the material in it were retained by me. Since this German edition has been 
    successful, not only critically but commercially, I would like to offer the 
    English originals to publishers here. What this short book contains are long 
    comprehensive profiles of Gertrude Stein, Robert Wilson, and Merce Cunningham, 
    along with a shorter profile of Charles Ives and three pieces about John Cage--one 
    a critical review of his poetry (from the ~New York Times Book Review~), the 
    second an unusual interwoven conversation about his ~Empty Words~, and the 
    third a more conventional interview about his ~Writings Through Finnegans 
    Wake~. The book's theme is announced in the opening sentences of its preface: 
    &quot;Just as America is different from Europe, so American artists at their 
    best are different. In the following pages are essays about some of the most 
    different artists ever to have come from my home shores, and what connects 
    these essays to each other, what makes them a book, is my sense that collectively 
    they reveal an American imagination that is fundamentally different from European 
    or Oriental, perhaps even more different than America itself is from Europe.&quot; 
    In the original manuscript were chapters that were not translated, but could 
    be restored to this English edition--long profiles of Kenneth Burke and John 
    Ashbery (both from the ~Times~) and shorter pieces on Phillip Glass, Dick 
    Higgins, and Don Celender. All the pieces are written to be accessible (except 
    perhaps one of the Cage conversations), for the book should appeal to students 
    of contemporary art as much as literate laymen. Editors wishing to consider 
    either the German edition or the English manuscript are advised please to 
    contact me. ~(1984)~</p>

  <p>~FURTHER WORK WITH LANGUAGE IN HOLOGRAPHY~</p>
  <p>For the past few years, I have been envisioning two kinds of holograms that 
    would use language entwined in capabilities unique to holography: one would 
    involve a multitude of words that are not just orthographic palindromes but 
    also visually self-reflective (MOM, HUH, WOW, TOOT, MUM, TIT, TAT, TOT, TOOT-TOOT, 
    etc.) in a 360 degree hologram, so that they continually spin on themselves, 
    perhaps in combination with words whose visual reversals are not identical 
    but other words (such as, MAY-YAM, HAY-YAH, etc.). This strikes me as quite 
    feasible. The second hologram would involve the creation, probably on a flat 
    (painterly) plate, structures of verbal-visual revelation that would require 
    the spectator to move his or her head, either from side to side or up and 
    down, to see words behind the initial foreground word, or to see how the lines 
    of some letters metamorphose into the lines of other letters, thereby making 
    other words that ideally relate critically to the initial words. The realization 
    of this hologram depends upon further research into current capabilities. 
    For each of these pieces, I might also create a complementary audiotape comparable 
    to the one produced for ~On Holography~ (1978). This proposal extends from 
    my earlier work with visual poetry and then with language in film and videotape.

  <p>~CARIBBEAN SOUND~</p>
  <p>It has been observed that there is a particular sonic quality common to much 
    Caribbean speech, even though its speakers came from different islands and 
    are speaking different languages (among them, English, French, Spanish, Dutch, 
    Danish, Papiamento), often with diverse accents. It is also true that much 
    of this speech is unusually beautiful in ways audible to ears that hardly 
    understand its words. What I would like to do in this piece is get at an aural 
    definition of this Caribbean sound by recording natives from all over the 
    Antilles and then mixing these recordings on a multitrack machine into a continuous 
    sound piece. In my initial field recordings, I would expect to confine the 
    speakers to a limited range of verbal materials, such as recitals of familiar 
    prayers (the Twenty-third Psalm, the Lord's Prayer) and identifications of 
    their native lands and perhaps their languages; for since this is to be a 
    piece of audio art, rather than a documentary, there shouldn't be any commentary. 
    Nonetheless, the materials will be composed to be comprehensible to listeners 
    familiar with western languages. It is anticipated that most of the speakers 
    will be recorded in New York City, which has large colonies of West Indians, 
    and that I will be using the assistance of student interns descendant from 
    these groups. In the evolution of my work &quot;The Caribbean Sound&quot; 
    descends from ~Invocations~ (1981), which was about the sound of the language 
    of prayer, as heard in ministers speaking over two dozen languages, and ~The 
    Eight Nights of Hanukah~ (1983), which was about the various accents of the 
    Diaspora as heard in a single Hebrew prayer. I would like to believe that 
    with minimal introduction &quot;Caribbean Sound&quot; could eventually be 
    broadcast in public stations in Canada, Germany, Britain, Holland, France, 
    Spain, Sweden and the United States. Should anyone have any suggestions for 
    support, as well as critical ideas, could you please communicate with me.

  <p>~COLLABORATION TOWARD THE PRODUCTION OF SOUND FICTION (AUDIO NARRATIVE)~</p>
  <p>Paul Kresh and Richard Kostelanetz, both writers and radio artists both, 
    began meeting in early 1985 to discuss the production of &quot;Sound Fiction,&quot; 
    which the latter defines (in a forthcoming book of his essays on fiction) 
    as &quot;stories whose principal means of narrative enhancement would be acoustic 
    [rather than verbal], whose ultimate realization would be on audiotape (whatever 
    printed text becoming the equivalent of a musical score).&quot; One suggestive 
    example in their minds is Naoya Uchimura's ~Marathon~ (1958), in which, to 
    quote Mark Ensign Cory:</p>
  <p> The plot is carried by two micro-durational or rhythmic figures: the anapest 
    of [the runner's] breathing and the iambus of his footsteps. Each can be extremely 
    effective, as in the moment when the steady rhythm of [the runner's] controlled 
    breathing begins to falter, or when the clean beat of his footsteps becomes 
    uncertain and then is momentarily obscured by a passing competitor.</p>
  <p>Another precursor is Ronald Steckel and Walter Bachauer's ~Das Ohrenlicht~ 
    (WDR/NDR/SFB, 1984), in which the protagonist responds to audibly different 
    acoustic spaces. Kresh and Kostelanetz plan to start their exploration with 
    &quot;generic stories&quot; told with the fewest possible words. Among later 
    possibilities might be stories exclusively of less definite, if not abstract 
    sounds that would nonetheless succeed each other with a narrative thrust--<br />
    metamorphose in a narrative way.</p>
  <p> Paul Kresh has produced radio programs for over thirty years. He has also 
    worked as an executive at both Caedmon and Spoken Arts, the two most prominent 
    producers of literary records in America (and N.Y.). Among his writings are 
    many reviews of records of music and spoken arts, the latter most visibly 
    in the ~New York Times~, and a book about Isaac Bashevis Singer. His creative 
    compositions for choral speech date back thirty years. Richard Kostelanetz 
    has produced extended ~hÃ¶rspiele~ (ear-plays) for German radio since 1981. 
    One of these works--~Invocations~ (1981)--appeared here as a Folkways Record. 
    Australian Broadcasting recently invited him to produce a second retrospective 
    feature about his &quot;Audio Writing.&quot; He has also written extensively 
    on American sound poetry and radio art, in addition to scripting radio features 
    about both subjects for public stations abroad.</p>
  <p> Though Kresh and Kostelanetz have different literary-musical tastes, the 
    former invariably disparaging the avant-garde admired by the latter (both 
    arguing endlessly while exchanging favorite records and tapes), they come 
    together over a common enthusiasm for speech-music and the possibilities of 
    acoustic literature. They hope that the results of their collaboration will 
    appear not only on radio stations but on records and/or tapes. ~(1985)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~THE WRITING OF FOUR EXTENDED ESSAYS OF RADIO CRITICISM~</p>
  <p>l. For Westdeutscher Rundfunk Richard Kostelanetz organized, edited and scripted 
    a seventy-five-minute feature on the Radio Art of his late friend Glenn Gould. 
    Though it is commonly known that Gould was one of the great musicians of the 
    age, his recorded performances remaining best-sellers, Americans are less 
    familiar with his radio compositions, which are rarely broadcast here. With 
    special dispensation from the Gould estate, Kostelanetz heard them all (as 
    only three are now publicly available) and in his German-<br />
    language radio feature focused upon their technical and conceptual innovations. 
    We propose that Kostelanetz be commissioned to ~write~, now in English, a 
    long critical essay based upon this research. Most of the essay will be devoted 
    to Gould's trilogy about isolation in Canada and the three extended portraits 
    of musicians (Stokowski, Schoenberg, Richard Strauss). This should be considered 
    a sequel to Kostelanetz's earlier long critical essays on radio excellence 
    that were likewise adapted from features commissioned by radio stations abroad--one 
    on Radio Comedy as the Principal Tradition of American Radio Drama (funded 
    in 1982) and another on the Radio Art of John Cage (funded in 1984). Both 
    ~Perspectives of New Music~ and a new magazine envisioned by the Museum of 
    Broadcasting (NYC) have asked to publish this proposed essay.</p>
  <p>2. Future Press would also like to commission Kostelanetz to make an extended 
    critical essay of the script of his radio &quot;Portrait of New York City 
    Radio,&quot; which was commissioned by Klaus Lindemann of Sender Freies Berlin. 
    Here Kostelanetz focuses upon the abundance of stations on the NYC dial, combined 
    with the absence of a detailed radio schedule (comparable to those in German 
    newspapers or ~TV Guide~ for television here), to identify the American radio 
    policy of specialized around-the-clock narrow-casting. After characterizing 
    the different sorts of programming, he concludes that in an inadvertent way 
    the diverse abundance of NYC radio constitutes a major unplanned achievement 
    of American broadcasting.</p>
  <p>3. The elaboration of an interview (in German), also commissioned by WDR, 
    with the distinguished art psychologist Rudolf Arnheim about his pioneering 
    book on ~Radio: An Art of Sound~ (1936). From a translation of this interview, 
    and ideas generated from it, Kostelanetz expects to produce a critical reconsideration 
    of that first great theoretical text from the perspective of the present, 
    in contrast to such current critical literature about radio as Mark Ensign 
    Cory's ~The Emergence of an Acoustical Art Form~ (1974), C. H. Sterling and 
    J. M. Kittross's ~Stay Tuned~ (1978), Tony Schwartz's ~Media: The Second God~ 
    (1981), Ian Rodger's ~Radio Drama~ (1982) and Klaus SchÃ¶ning's ~HÃ¶rspielmacher~ 
    (1983). This may well be the first critical essay in English on the development 
    of radio criticism.</p>
  <p>4. ~Perspectives of New Music~ has commissioned Kostelanetz to produce a 
    fifty- page essay about his own &quot;Texts &amp; Proposals for Radio.&quot; 
    Since ~Perspectives~ does not pay, we would like to support his writing of 
    this, along with his essay on his &quot;New York City&quot; (in progress since 
    1982) for publication in both ~Sites-Architectural Magazine~ (N.Y.) and an 
    anthology to appear from Ohio State University Press (neither of which pay 
    either). Both essays draw upon his feature &quot;Audio Writing&quot; produced 
    for both SFB &amp; Australian Broadcasting. Kostelanetz remains one of the 
    few Americans writing and publishing extended essays on native radio art (as 
    well as producing radio features about it, exclusively so far for stations 
    abroad, alas). It is anticipated that, since he has published many books before, 
    his essays on American Radio Art will likewise soon appear between covers.

  <p>~AN ANTHOLOGY OF &quot;THE AMERICAN TRADITION OF POETRY&quot;~</p>
  <p>This selection would represent a radical reinterpretation of the nature of 
    excellence in American poetry. In contrast to, say, Jerome Rothenberg's ~America 
    a Prophecy~ (1973), which collects a purportedly prophetic tradition, or ~The 
    New Oxford Book of American Verse~ (1976), which pretends to reprint everybody 
    important, or ~The Treasury of American Poetry~ (Doubleday, 1978), which is 
    an incoherent compendium, &quot;The American Tradition of Poetry&quot; would 
    focus upon those native works which realize technical inventions in the history 
    of poetry. It is my thesis that the principal American tradition in poetry, 
    as in music and in painting, is one of formal innovation in the machinery 
    of the art--a tradition of doing technically what had not been done before, 
    either in Europe or here. Therefore, ~The American Tradition in Poetry~ will 
    emphasize the more inventive poems of John Wilson, John Fiske, Edgar Allen 
    Poe, Walt Whitman, Gertrude Stein, Vachel Lindsay, E.E. Cummings, Langston 
    Hughes, Eugene Jolas, Melvin Tolson, Bob Brown, Charles Olson, Jack Kerouac, 
    John Ashbery, John Cage, and Jackson Mac Low, as well as those contemporaries 
    extending this indigenous tradition--in sum, a succession of selections that 
    will, like innovative art itself, surprise as it persuades. ~The American 
    Tradition in Poetry~ will also contain a substantial introduction similar 
    to those in other anthologies of mine; this new essay will develop ideas initially 
    presented in critical essays collected in my book ~The Old Poetries and the 
    New~ (Univ. of Michigan, 1981). Because the theme of this proposed anthology 
    is so particular, I expect that it will be considerably shorter than the competing 
    anthologies of American poetry (and thus more reasonably priced, especially 
    in paperback) and that it will be particularly successful with students of 
    American literature, not only as the principal book in more advanced courses, 
    but also as an alternate selection in the standard surveys (because it collects 
    poems that are not in the other anthologies). &quot;The American Tradition 
    in Poetry&quot; could be delivered within a year of contracting. ~(1985)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~FIVE RADIO PROGRAMS OF &quot;THE VOICES OF AMERICAN WRITING&quot;~</p>
  <p>In lecturing abroad about American Literature, I find myself frequently characterizing 
    the individual speaking voices of the great American writers, dealing as well 
    as I can with the question of what they ~sound~ like. I point out that recordings 
    of them reading aloud demonstrate that in America the accents of the major 
    writers are quite various--there is no preferred or uniform style of literary 
    speaking. Such recordings also fulfill our curiosity about familiar authors, 
    much as literary biographies do, and incidentally add a dimension to our experience 
    of their work, as we can hear how these writers wanted their works to sound, 
    at least to themselves. With these themes in mind, as well as with a sense 
    of my audience as non-American, if not non-English-speaking, I compiled a 
    collection of taped excerpts, drawing upon sources both public and private. 
    My proposal is that these excerpts be distributed into five radio programs, 
    each thirty to forty-five minutes long, each with its own sub-title. These 
    excerpts will be prefaced with my general introductions to the individual 
    writers and specific remarks about the excerpt, both no more than two minutes 
    long. These commentaries are intended to be simple (as the examples are often 
    difficult) and easily translated; the excerpts, all shorter than three minutes 
    in length, should not be translated, however, as hearing them in their original 
    form is the purpose of this series. The five programs deal respectively with 
    the following people:</p>
  <p>1. American poets who made their reputations prior to l940 (Eliot, Pound, 
    Frost, W. Williams, Sandburg, Lindsay, Cummings, Millay, Langston Hughes, 
    Stevens, Ogden Nash).</p>
  <p>2. American fictioners who made their reputations prior to l940 (Hemingway, 
    Dos Passos, Faulkner, Stein, K. A. Porter, R. P. Warren, S. J. Perelman).</p>
  <p>3. Postwar poets (Roethke, Lowell, Berryman, Bishop, Plath, Ginsberg, O'Hara, 
    Rexroth).</p>
  <p>4. Postwar fictioners (Mailer, Jones, Ellison, Styron, Heller, Baldwin, Updike, 
    Roth, Vonnegut, Barth, Burroughs, Nabokov, I. B. Singer [in both English and 
    Yiddish]).</p>
  <p>5. Playwrights and essayists (A. Miller, T. Williams, Eliot [as playwright], 
    Albee, H. L. Mencken, H. Miller, Dorothy Parker, James Thurber, Capote).</p>
  <p>My expectation is that these selections are sufficiently classic to make 
    programs that can be rebroadcast as often as the station wishes. European 
    radio executives interested in sponsoring the &quot;Voices of American Writing&quot; 
    should contact me. ~(1985)~</p>

  <p>~&quot;MEDIA WRITING&quot;: PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN LITERATURE~</p>
  <p>This proposal for &quot;Media Writing&quot; extends into new territory what 
    Richard Kostelanetz has done over the past decade in audiotape, videotape 
    and holography. Among the territories he would like to explore are Sound Fiction, 
    which is to say stories whose principal means of narrative enhancement would 
    be acoustic, whose ultimate realization appears not in print but on audiotape. 
    (Whatever printed texts there are, instead, become merely the equivalent of 
    a musical score.) This differs from the aim of ~Black Box~, American Audio 
    Prose Library et al., which regard themselves as publishing (actually, ~re~publishing) 
    on audiotape a literature that already exists on the page. This also differs 
    from music in its literary base of language and story. One precursor strongly 
    in Kostelanetz's mind is Naoya Uchimura's piece for Japanese radio, ~Marathon~ 
    (1958), in which, to quote the radio critic Mark Ensign Cory, &quot;The plot 
    is carried by two micro-durational or rhythmic figures: the anapest of [the 
    runner's] breathing and the iambus of his footsteps. Each can be extremely 
    effective, as in the moment when the steady rhythm of [the runner's] controlled 
    breathing begins to falter, or when the clean beat of his footsteps becomes 
    uncertain and then is momentarily obscured by a passing competitor.&quot; 
    No one else in America is making sound fiction. Two writers approaching it, 
    in certain ways, are Bliem Kern (N.Y.) and Dennis Williams (A.Z.).</p>
  <p> In his work, Kostelanetz is approaching sound fiction from two directions--radio 
    compositions (mostly commissioned by stations abroad) and declamations of 
    his own texts in which he tries to produce on audiotape an aural experience 
    that cannot be done live. On the enclosed retrospective, based upon a shorter 
    program produced for Australian Broadcasting, consider for the first category 
    the excerpts from ~Invocations~, the piece about the sound of the language 
    of prayer in over two dozen tongues (based upon ~Finnegans Wake~). The score 
    that does exist (reprinted in the current issue of ~Perspectives of New Music~) 
    was, in fact, composed after the fact and is, in effect, an incomplete chart 
    for its re-realization. The same authorial procedure informed Kostelanetz's 
    redoing of ~Under Milk Wood~, in this case about sounds unique to his hometown--~New 
    York City~, parts of which are also on the enclosed tape. For the second category, 
    consider the excerpt from ~Seductions~, in which sixteen seduction stories 
    are interwoven one sentence at a time, and told in sixteen acoustically different 
    versions of the narrator's voice. The text for this can be found in his book 
    ~More Short Fictions~ (Assembling Press, 1980). Speaking generally, it could 
    be said that in future work Kostelanetz plans to combine the narrative direction 
    of ~Seductions~ with the compositional procedures of ~Invocations~.</p>
  <p> It is hard to justify this for a &quot;radio&quot; application, because, 
    to be frank, there is no reason to believe sophisticated literary audiotape 
    can be broadcast immediately on American radio, as it now is exists, in any 
    consequential way. Kostelanetz knows, because he has tried for over a decade 
    (and continues to try, most recently with a feature production grant from 
    American Public Radio). While ~Invocations~ (1981), for instance, was initially 
    broadcast in its entirety over SFB (Berlin), KRO (Holland), Australian Broadcasting, 
    Yugoslav Radio and, abridged, over Canadian Broadcasting, here it was aired 
    only over WBAI in New York. However, once it became a Folkways record, ~Invocations~ 
    could be aired over American radio gratis, in circumstances beyond the author's 
    control. Over WNYC-FM in New York City, for instance, it has been aired at 
    least twice in the past year. With this principle in mind, we should note 
    that Moses Asch, the founding chief of Folkways, has asked for further Kostelanetz 
    work. Should Folkways decline, his works can be offered to other publishers 
    of audiotape, and then distributed through the American Audio Prose Library, 
    among others. In truth, since American radio stations, both public and private, 
    are not prepared to pay for what they broadcast, the best way to distribute 
    Audio Writing in America is not to petition radio stations directly but, after 
    obtaining sponsorship elsewhere, to issue it on records or tapes that radio 
    stations (and individuals) can then play as they wish.</p>
  <p> Most of this new work will be done in the twenty-four-track console of the 
    Electronic Music Studio of Stockholm, where Kostelanetz has worked annually, 
    gratis, since 1981. Kostelanetz has also applied for a renewal of an earlier 
    residency at the Public Access Synthesizer Studio in New York and then for 
    an initial residency at Real Art Ways in Hartford. All these studios, it should 
    be noted, offer only their facilities; there is no financial aid for him or 
    other personnel. Since machinery at each of these studios is unfamiliar to 
    Kostelanetz, he generally must hire at his own expense an engineer to assist 
    him.</p>
  <p> Kostelanetz's recent video has exploited primarily the character-generator, 
    which is the machine that electronically generates letters on a cathode-ray 
    tube. As his own typographer, he has put his stories (mostly ~Epiphanies~) 
    on videoscreens in various visual arrangements, making them visible for lengths 
    of time unrelated to length (which is itself a technique worth exploring); 
    and progressing from a simple character-generator (at Experimental Intermedia 
    in NYC), he recently used a more sophisticated machine, with more typefaces, 
    each in two fonts, at the Experimental TV Laboratory in Owego, N.Y. Kostelanetz's 
    earlier Video Writing has been internationally exhibited. Stations here and 
    abroad have asked in particular for shorter versions of ~Epiphanies~ to broadcast 
    mostly between other programs; but without necessary assistance, Kostelanetz 
    has so far been unable to honor their requests. In future Video Writing, he 
    expects to go beyond the realization of prior texts by typing works directly 
    on the character-generator, and also to explore more sophisticated image-processing 
    of words, as begun in the tape of his poems &quot;Duets&quot; produced at 
    the Experimental TV Laboratory in the fall of 1985. ~(1985)~</p>

  <p> The architectural philosopher Colin Rowe has suggested that conceptual architecture 
    is &quot;the presence of absence. . . something that quite simply is ~not

  <p>~OUR STRONGEST SOUNDS: AUDIO ART IN NORTH AMERICA~</p>
  <p>The principal purpose of this series of radio programs is introducing American 
    audiences to the native Audio Art that, its excellence notwithstanding, is 
    largely unfamiliar. A secondary purpose is gathering into a single context 
    and narrative the intelligence and experience of earlier radio features that 
    were initially prepared for broadcast by public stations in Germany, Sweden 
    and Australia (and, for one index of success, have been rebroadcast). Since 
    these are worldclass presentations about American Audio Art, wouldn't it be 
    appropriate to produce them for American public radio as well? (We shouldn't 
    be, or allow ourselves to look, bush-league.) The unifying factors will be 
    (1) the theme of native audio excellence; (2) the critical intelligence of 
    the author/narrator; (3) opening and closing logos.</p>
  <p> Whenever a subject in the following list is divided into two thirty-minute 
    programs, that indicates that the original was over sixty minutes long. This 
    history notwithstanding, rest assured that all will be rewritten and narrated 
    as though one literate American were speaking to others and that the choice 
    of examples will be redone with American listeners in mind.</p>
  <p>Tentative List of the Thirteen Programs</p>
  <p>1. An introduction identifying my subject as the best American Audio Art 
    (as distinct from radio journalism on one side and music on the other) and 
    then presenting, in narrative with examples, the unfamiliar thesis that historically 
    the best American radio drama has not been literary (on the British and European 
    models) but vernacular, as epitomized by radio comedy. I show how the principal 
    producers of radio comedy discovered the unique dramatic capabilities of the 
    audio medium. Taking the familiar example of the tumbling closet in Fibber 
    McGee and Molly's domestic comedy, we suggest that, in addition to being a 
    great joke worth repeating, this comic scene succeeds in part because it goes 
    on so long. However, since no typical household closet has enough stuff to 
    fall for several seconds, the joke also succeeds precisely because it is heard, 
    not viewed--because radio forbids us to see. (It is not for nothing that such 
    jokes did not survive on television.) We then go onto other classic radio 
    sound effects that need not be seen, including ironic ones, such as Jack Benny's 
    Maxwell, whose success depends partially upon the audience's recognition that 
    the putative car doesn't quite sound like a car. From here we present rather 
    sophisticated self-reflexive jokes, such as Jack Benny's parody of Hemingway's 
    &quot;Snows of Kilimanjaro,&quot; which becomes a vehicle for showcasing the 
    virtuosity of Mel Blanc until Benny forecasts the sound of the alligator, 
    hears silence and then congratulates himself for imagining a sound Blanc cannot 
    do. We also examine the principle of radio's capacity for dramatic surprise 
    with the famous Jack Benny gag about &quot;your money or your life,&quot; 
    incidentally illustrating both Benny's genius for pregnant silences and Marshall 
    McLuhan's perception that to the blind all things are sudden. The material 
    in both this program and the next was initially prepared in 1982 for Westdeutscher 
    Rundfunk and subsequently rebroadcast on Sudwestfunk and Sveriges Radio. Both 
    also draw upon a 1982 grant for radio criticism awarded by the New York State 
    Council on the Arts.</p>
  <p>2. This program will focus upon the second great discovery of the pioneering 
    audio comedians that voice alone could wholly determine the audience's perception 
    of character. After an appreciation of the extraordinary talents of Freeman 
    Gosden and Charles Correll (who performed with aural veracity ~all~ the characters 
    in the early versions of ~Amos 'n Andy~), we will go into ironic variations 
    upon this capability, such as the denizens of Fred Allen's alley and Fanny 
    Brice's Baby Snooks. In this program too belongs an appreciation of the best 
    verbal humor, such as the recurring misunderstandings of Burns and Allen and 
    the double entendres of Abbott and Costello. (This last point was, alas, slighted 
    in the programs prepared for European audiences, because so much depends upon 
    intimate familiarity with the English language.)</p>
  <p>3. Our initial thesis notwithstanding, here we survey the best examples of 
    literary American radio drama during its short-lived golden age, 1938-46, 
    with excerpts from the work of Archibald MacLeish (~Fall of the City~), Orson 
    Welles, Norman Corwin and others. Our principal concerns are the aural presentation 
    of poetic language and the use of radio's expository conventions, such as 
    the newscast, for dramatic purposes.</p>
  <p>4. Since American radio art declined, while first-rate works disappeared 
    from our airwaves, in the decades after WWII, we leap forward to the late 
    sixties and look first not to the U.S. but to Canada, which has a stronger 
    tradition of supporting radio art, and focus upon Glenn Gould's trilogy about 
    isolation in Canada--~The Idea of North~ (1967), ~The Latecomers~ (1969) and 
    ~Quiet in the Land~ (1973). (These remain, in our opinion, the greatest works 
    of Audio Art ever produced in North America.) We show how Gould used the new 
    technology of multitrack tape to compose radio scenes from materials gathered 
    from disparate sources, rather than realizing a premeditated script, incidentally 
    putting into the same acoustic space sounds that are not normally heard together. 
    This program and the next draw upon a feature initially prepared in 1984 for 
    Westdeutscher Rundfunk.</p>
  <p>5. This features Gould's other radio masterpieces--incomparable portraits 
    of master musicians: Stokowski (1970), Schoenberg (1974) and Richard Straus 
    (1979), all of which combine spoken voice with a counterpoint of illustrative 
    music. As far as we can tell, these last three pieces are totally unknown 
    in the U.S.</p>
  <p>6. Returning south of the border, we follow a major American artist who has 
    for nearly a half-century done consequential work in and around radio, John 
    Cage, beginning with his ~Imaginary Landscape # 1~ (1939) and proceeding through 
    ~Imaginary Landscape # 4~ for twelve radios to ~Williams Mix~ (1953), his 
    pioneering tape collage. Since Cage, unlike Gould, is still with us, our commentary 
    will include excerpts from a recent interview with him.</p>
  <p>7. This will be a critical introduction to Cage's extraordinary, prize-winning 
    recent pieces for German radio--~Roaratorio~ (1979), ~Alphabet~ (1982), ~Muoyce~ 
    (1983), ~HMCIEX~ (1984)--which are, alas, also unknown here. The text for 
    this draws upon a 1984 grant for radio criticism from the New York State Council 
    on the Arts.</p>
  <p>8. and 9. A two-part survey of American language art that coheres in terms 
    of sound, rather than syntax and semantics, and thus must be heard to be &quot;read,&quot; 
    with brief examples from Charles Amirkhanian, Bliem Kern, Jim Theobald, Toby 
    Lurie, Beth Anderson, Jackson Mac Low, Jerome Rothenberg, Norman Henry Pritchard 
    II, Tom Johnson, Charlie Morrow et al. This and the next draw upon programs 
    of different lengths initially prepared for Australian Broadcasting, RAI (Italy) 
    and Sender Freies Berlin (in addition to research done on 1976 and 1978 grants 
    from the National Endowment for the Arts).</p>
  <p>10. The Audio Art of Charles Dodge, including an introduction to computer-<br />
    assisted speech resynthesis and what he calls electronic radio drama, with 
    excerpts from ~The Days of Our Lives~, his production of Samuel Beckett's 
    ~Cascando~ and ~Any Resemblance Is Purely Coincidental~ (his dramatization 
    of a mighty tenor's frustrated attempt to find an appropriate accompaniment 
    to his voice). This draws upon an interview-feature prepared in 1984 for Australian 
    Broadcasting.</p>
  <p>11. The Audio Art of Doris Hays, emphasizing excerpts from her classic montage 
    of ~Southern Voices~, her polylingual ~Celebration of No~ and her more recent 
    interwoven symposium of interviews from women's peace camps. This draws upon 
    a separate interview-feature prepared, also in 1984, for Australian Broadcasting.</p>
  <p>12. Either a survey of current activity in American Audio Art, or another 
    portrait of a single American audio artist. (This and #3 will be the only 
    programs that are wholly fresh.)</p>
  <p>13. Reconsidering the recent fate of audio comedy in America, we notice that 
    since the mid-fifties (and the illustrative, unfortunate career of Stan Freberg) 
    the very best work has appeared first on records (to be rebroadcast on radio, 
    in contexts outside the authors' control, in contrast to the classic radio 
    comedy of our initial programs, which, paradoxically, now survives mostly 
    on disc reprints). For examples, we plan to feature record comedy that acknowledges 
    the characteristic sound and circumstances of radio, such as Peter Schickele's 
    portrayal of two earnest sports announcers describing Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. 
    The current situation of audio comedy in relation to radio and record, we 
    conclude, exemplifies that of contemporary native Audio Art in general (such 
    as the best works of Dodge and Hays already noticed). While acknowledging 
    current limitations, we will close with a plea for more production, within 
    the context of radio, of strong native Audio Art. This concluding program 
    draws upon another feature we are presently preparing for Westdeutscher Rundfunk. 
    ~(1985)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~TO REPRODUCE ~NACH WEISSENSEE~ IN ENGLISH, AMONG OTHER LANGUAGES~</p>
  <p>~Nach Weissensee~ is a sixty-five-minute radio feature about the Great Jewish 
    Cemetery of Berlin as the principal surviving relic of prewar Berlin. The 
    program is structured as a composed symposium of authentic ex-Berliners speaking 
    about the cemetery, which with 110,000 graves is the largest of its kind between 
    Warsaw and America, and the culture represented there. This German-language 
    feature was initially produced for RIAS, the American-owned station in West 
    Berlin, by the Berlin filmmaker Martin Koerber (who also made a film about 
    the cemetery in collaboration with Kostelanetz), the Berlin audio artist Michael 
    Maassen (who is also an actor in the Schaubuhne) and the American audio artist 
    Richard Kostelanetz. Well-reviewed in the Berlin press, ~Nach Weissensee~ 
    has since been accepted for rebroadcast elsewhere in the German radio system. 
    Of this radio feature, the eminent art psychologist Rudolf Arnheim (Berlin, 
    1904) wrote them, &quot;I want to tell you right away how deeply moving an 
    experience it was. I was impressed by the eloquence of the speakers, by the 
    authenticity of their memories, and the extraordinary variety of the approaches. 
    These are exactly the people I knew in Berlin, perhaps I knew some of them 
    personally, and therefore I felt very personally addressed. The tape is a 
    document of the first order.&quot; Given such success, Kostelanetz and Koerber 
    would like to reproduce ~Nach Weissensee~ in English, Dutch, French, Hebrew, 
    Yiddish and Spanish ~not~ by translating the original German version but by 
    the more authentic procedure of interviewing ex-Berliners presently fluent 
    in those other languages and from those interviews composing fresh radio features 
    with roughly similar structures and themes. As most of the original German 
    speakers were interviewed in New York, we already have enough taped materials 
    to produce an English version here. It is for assistance in preparing the 
    other versions, most of which would first be broadcast here, that we appeal 
    now. They would later be distributed to other stations here and abroad. The 
    tapes prepared for these radio programs may also be used in presentations/installations 
    to accompany the showing of thousands of slides taken in the cemetery today.

  <p> On the map of your empire, O Great Kahn, there must be room both for the 
    big, stone Fedora and the little Fedoras in glass globes. Not because they 
    are all equally real, but because all are only assumptions. The one contains 
    what is accepted as necessary when it is not yet so; the others, what is imagined 
    as possible and, a moment later, is possible no longer.--Italo Calvino, ~Invisible 
    Cities~ (1972)</p>
  <p>~FIRST AMERICAN BROADCAST OF TWO PROGRAMS INITIALLY PRODUCED FOR GERMAN RADIO:~</p>
  <p>1. ~The Gospels~ (1982), 120 minutes long, is a continuous fugue of the first 
    four books of the New Testament, which, we remember, tell the same story in 
    four different ways. Here four speakers--two British and two American--are 
    electronically mixed to perform as a string quartet might, for one or another 
    speaker becomes dominant as his or her lines become more meaningful or more 
    poetic. It could be said that this is the Fifth Gospel, a Gospel that could 
    not exist until the age of audiotape, the Passion not of Matthew and Mark 
    and Luke and John, but of Matthew-Mark-Luke-John, which we should now consider 
    the Ur-Gospel from which the others are descended. ~The Gospels~ was initially 
    commissioned as the English warm-up for a German version, ~Die Evangelien~, 
    that was broadcast over Westdeutscher Rundfunk in 1982. Parts of ~The Gospels~ 
    have been aired over Australian Broadcasting and many local American stations 
    (as an episode in Richard Kostelanetz's ~Audio Writing~), while the whole 
    was broadcast over WBAI (New York) in its &quot;Morning Music&quot; show, 
    continuously mixed in live time with an interview with the composer and solicitous 
    telephone calls. What is proposed for American distribution is remixing the 
    original four-track tape to bring it closer to the composer's intentions, 
    and also adding occasional voice-over comments with the composer discussing 
    his purposes and giving appropriate professional credits.</p>
  <p>2. ~Invocations~ (1981) is a sixty-minute radio piece about the sound, the 
    quality and the content of the language of prayer. Sixty ministers, speaking 
    prayers in over two dozen languages, were recorded in West Berlin. These tapes 
    were then mixed on a twenty-four-track machine into duets, quintets, successive 
    solos and choruses into a sustained speech work whose structural model is 
    J. S. Bach's ~St. Matthew Passion~. Ecumenical in spirit, the piece brings 
    together into the same acoustical space prayers that are not normally heard 
    together, just as James Joyce's ~Finnegans Wake~ brings into a single frame 
    languages that are not commonly read together. The original ~Invocations~ 
    opened with the Lord's Prayer in German; that version presently available 
    here on the Folkways record opens with prayers in Hebrew and Syriac. What 
    is offered now is the first American broadcast of the version beginning with 
    prayers in English. The original tape will also be remixed to give more definition 
    to certain passages in its second half and to incorporate appropriate professional 
    credits within its sixty minutes.</p>
  <p> May I propose the national distribution of both these pieces as &quot;Holiday 
    Specials.&quot; ~Invocations~ will go out early in December, for broadcast 
    during the holiday season; ~The Gospels~, a few weeks before Easter, ideally 
    for broadcast on Easter morning. First airings by affiliated stations will 
    be gratis; rights for subsequent broadcasts are negotiable. Mailings will 
    precede each transmission over the satellite; promotional broadcasts (for 
    preview use by member stations) will precede the feed of each piece. There 
    is no other way, short of distributing free records and cassettes, to introduce 
    alternative radio art to American listeners living outside the sophisticated 
    cities. Some may think this not worth doing--that the innocent should remain 
    blessedly innocent; I think otherwise. ~(1985)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~SCREENINGS OF ~A BERLIN LOST~, A PRIZE-WINNING FILM~</p>
  <p>Martin Koerber and I are pleased to announce the completion of ~A Berlin 
    Lost~, our twenty-one-minute, 16 mm. documentary film about the Great Jewish 
    Cemetery of Berlin, Weissensee, as the principal surviving symbol of Berlin's 
    greatest years (1860-1940). In this subtle visual history, the cemetery and 
    its evocative gravestones become an archaeological window into a Berlin that, 
    alas, no longer exists. On the sound track is the authentic testimony, now 
    in English, of ex-Berliners remembering the cemetery and the world represented 
    there.</p>
  <p> ~A Berlin Lost~ is an authentic reproduction of our earlier film ~Ein verlorenes 
    Berlin~ (1984), which has been shown at festivals at Berlin, Munich and Oberhausen; 
    but since the gravestones on the film's visual track already provide so much 
    to read, we chose ~not~ to subtitle the German film (or allow the inauthenticities 
    of overdubbing), but, instead, to reproduce it with a wholly new English sound 
    track composed from fresh interviews with ex-<br />
    Berliners. Not only because the sound tracks differ in content, but also because 
    the imagery begs to be reseen, our recommendation is that both versions ideally 
    be screened in sequence. (For viewing the German version, we can provide printed 
    translations of its sound track into English or Spanish.) We have also made 
    fresh versions in Swedish and French (both available with printed English 
    translations) and expect to produce sound tracks in Spanish and Hebrew (hopefully 
    with printed English translations).</p>
  <p> We think ~A Berlin Lost~ would especially interest ex-Berliners and their 
    descendants, many of whom know about the cemetery but have never seen it (in 
    part because it is now in East Berlin), as well as those generally interested 
    in European Jewish culture and the life of great cities. This English film 
    has already been screened at international festivals in Edinburgh and Melbourne. 
    Accepted by FILMEX (Los Angeles) for its next presentations, it also toured 
    with the 1986 Jewish Film Festival and won a 1986 award at the Ann Arbor Film 
    Festival, later touring under its auspices. Either of us can accompany the 
    film(s), answering questions about it and Weissensee today. Institutions interested 
    in screening our work(s), in sponsoring our accompanying presentations or 
    in auditing 3/4&quot; U-Matic or 1/2&quot; VHS videotapes, should write or 
    call either of us. ~(1985)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p> Grants should function, as I've said elsewhere, to make happen what would 
    not otherwise happen. That's certainly been true for my work recently, especially 
    if you add residencies at video and holographic studios, which represent a 
    kind of grant, if facilities and technicians are offered to you free. I don't 
    see how grants &quot;co-opt&quot; innovation, to use your term, unless you 
    think that applicants withhold or disguise innovative ambitions to suite the 
    mediocre tastes of those cultural powerhouses mentioned before. What can be 
    said for sure that a lack of grants can destroy, or prevent, innovation almost 
    as ruthlessly as censorship can.--R.K., in an interview (1990)</p>
  <p>~PRODUCTION RESIDENCY FOR HOLOGRAPHY WITH LANGUAGE~</p>
  <p>To produce another hologram whose entire visual content would be words, that 
    would exploit the unique capabilities of holography and that would hopefully 
    utilize flat black-and-white techniques (especially since what bothers me 
    most about my initial hologram, produced several years ago, is the hued rainbow). 
    In principle, I believe there are only two colors worthy of Art--black and 
    white; all other colors are worthy only of illustrations).</p>
  <p> I have two ideas and two general biases: one idea involves creating, within 
    a 360 degree integral, a field of visually palindromic words (e.g., MOM, WOW) 
    that would spin around over and through each other. The second idea involves 
    a triptych of parallelly arrayed, horizontally aligned three-part overlapping 
    words, all of whose center words would be six to eight letters long, such 
    as ALCO/HOLOGRAM/PANT, TU/MULTIPLEX/ICON, LOG/JAMBOREE/FER, NITRO/GENITAL/KATIVE, 
    OINTM/ENTHRALL/UVIAL, BE/GATEFOLD/ER, etc. Beyond that, in working with language 
    in media, especially in residencies in sophisticated installations, my first 
    general bias is to examine the most advanced techniques (those the host technicians 
    want most to develop) and then to figure out how best to fill them with interesting 
    language. My second general desire is to make a hologram with more comedy 
    than the medium has previously witnessed. ~(1985)~</p>

  <p>~THE GREAT AMERICAN PERSON OF AVANT-GARDE LETTERS: GERTRUDE STEIN~</p>
  <p>This tentative table of contents focuses upon the most experimental works, 
    in support of the thesis implicit in its title, and in contrast to earlier 
    Stein anthologies that tended to emphasize ~Toklas~ and ~Melanctha~ (and which 
    this at once supplements and succeeds). Our theme is that these extreme writings 
    are more relevant to current concerns; and if you accept them, in contrast 
    to the more accessible Stein featured in, say, the Modern Library selection, 
    then Stein becomes, as the title says, &quot;The Great American Person of 
    Avant-Garde Letters.&quot; This book will differ from ~The Yale Gertrude Stein~ 
    (which I edited and introduced) in drawing entirely upon the larger corpus 
    of works published during her lifetime (rather than after). It will also have 
    a more general, elementary introduction. All these selections are, as far 
    as I can establish, presently in the public domain.</p>

  <p> In every branch of learning and in every center of research, some persons 
    are found capable of converting a thoughtful piece of curiosity into a project 
    so that it will appear ideal--or, as it said, &quot;a natural&quot;--for foundation 
    support. Other people, also able but without this knack, must have their projects 
    &quot;processed,&quot; and still others learn the trick. The consequence is 
    a strong urge in many a man to stultify himself at the expense of what used 
    to be called intellectual honesty. The scholar or scientist salves his conscience 
    with the thought that he will turn the proceeds to good use. He hopes to do 
    &quot;his own work&quot; behind the shelter of phrases denoting expected attitudes; 
    to do fundamental research though proposing foundational research.--Jacques 
    Barzun, ~The House of Intellect~ (1957)</p>
  <p>~INSTALLATIONS/CONCERTS OF ~NEW YORK CITY</p>
  <p>~New York City~ (in progress since 1983) is an extended audiotape composed 
    from hours of field recordings of sounds that are particular to New York City: 
    subways of various kinds, cacophonous garbage trucks, dense crowds in small 
    spaces, an abundance of answering machines, the din on the floor of the Commodities 
    Exchange, other languages spoken with bits of English, peculiar aural juxtapositions 
    of city and sea that can be found along the shoreline, the polylingual radio 
    spectrum, the echoes of canyon-like streets, sirens familiar to every television 
    viewer, among many others. Rather than simply presenting these sounds in the 
    tradition of audio documentaries, I tried to create, during thirty days of 
    intensive work at the Electronic Music Studio of Stockholm, an audio experience 
    that is at once a presentation of New York and a musical composition in the 
    tradition of Charles Ives, Edgard VarÃ¨se and John Cage. My initial plan, curiously, 
    was to write an audio chamber symphony comparable to Dylan Thomas's ~Under 
    Milk Wood~ (l953), an affectionate portrait of the author's hometown; but 
    this approach eventually struck me as clearly insufficient for this new age 
    of audiotape and multitracking. It would be more appropriate, I decided, for 
    me to collect sounds, including voices, that are characteristic of the city 
    in which I was born and raised, where I have lived my entire life, and from 
    these to compose on audiotape my own ~Under Milk Wood~ that proceeds wholly 
    as itself, without introduction or other commentary. Another esthetic model 
    in my mind at the beginning was, of course, the poetry of Walt Whitman, with 
    its encompassing sense of the unprecedented experience of this city, and I 
    often thought about a certain 1920s photograph by the Dutch artist Paul Citroen. 
    Entitled variously ~Metropolis~ or ~The City~, it is a vertically arrayed 
    montage composed mostly of images of vertical buildings; but rather than setting 
    these buildings against a skyline (and then revealing primary nature), Citroen 
    stacked the buildings atop one another, filling the rectangular space from 
    bottom to top, thereby creating the image of urban life as a comprehensive 
    entity, much as my own composition would be wholly about this second man-made 
    Nature. Typically for me now, I began with a literary concept and a literary 
    model, but both my means and ends turned out to be indigenous to media other 
    than print. Westdeutscher Rundfunk initially commissioned my ~New York City~ 
    as part of a series of four sixty-minute programs on the world's great cities 
    (along with Pierre Henry's ~Paris~ and Alfred Doblin's historic ~Berlin Alexanderplatz~). 
    Nonetheless, since I am from time to time asked to give concerts (and object 
    to public performances of audiotapes alone), it occurred to me, as a sometime 
    maker of visual art and photography, to produce thousands of slides of images 
    that were likewise particular to New York City, and to project these images 
    through a brace of synchronized slide projectors to fill up the audience's 
    space visually, much as the sound on my tape fills up the acoustic space. 
    As several passages I made for the original WDR version turned out to have 
    too many subtleties for radio broadcast in Germany, it seemed appropriate 
    to restore them to this ~American~ concert version that would then be two 
    hours long, and thus an evening-length work. Later it occurred to me that 
    if this fusion of sight and sound were successful, my ~New York City~ could 
    even become a continuous installation in either a museum or a public setting 
    (and in the future perhaps a historic document about the City as it sounded 
    and looked in the early 1980s). ~(1985)~</p>

  <p>~A COLLABORATION WITH THE COMPOSER PAUL LANSKY~</p>
  <p>Paul Lansky is a distinguished musician, a professor of music at Princeton, 
    who has established himself over the past fifteen years as one of the principal 
    American composers of computer music. His works are available on CRI, Nonesuch 
    and Columbia-Odyssey records. He is a former member of the Dorian Wind Quintet 
    (French horn) and a current member of the editorial board of ~Perspectives 
    of New Music~. He has received a Bearns Prize, the ISCM-League of Composers 
    Electronic Music Award, the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters 
    Composers Award, an award from the Koussevitzky Foundation, and a grant from 
    the National Endowment for the Arts. Among his extraordinary techniques for 
    speech composition is &quot;all-pole linear prediction, in which the original 
    source material (a recording of a single reading of the poem) is analyzed 
    in small 'frames,' each 1/112th of a second, and the information gained allows 
    reconstruction in which pitch, rhythm and timbre may be controlled almost 
    at will.&quot;</p>
  <p> Richard Kostelanetz is an experimental writer and broadcaster who has developed 
    an interest in writing texts appropriate to the unique styles of contemporary 
    composers. For Charles Dodge, he made ~He Met Her in the Park~, which was 
    translated into Swedish to fulfill a Dodge commission from Swedish Radio and 
    subsequently aired as ~Motte Henne i Parken~ over Swedish radio and in concerts. 
    A version with the original English text was later realized by Dodge at the 
    Center for Computer Music at Brooklyn College to fulfill a commission from 
    Voices (Everett Frost-Faith Wilding), which had received commissioning funds 
    from the NEA. Voices expects to broadcast ~He Met Her in the Park~, along 
    with a Kostelanetz-Dodge conversation, as part of their series of four programs 
    of Audio Art. It is expected that both ~He Met Her in the Park~ and ~Motte 
    Henne i Parken~ will eventually appear on two sides of a long-playing record. 
    Otherwise, Kostelanetz remains an unaffiliated writer/artist.</p>
  <p> Kostelanetz and Lansky began a correspondence about collaboration early 
    in 1985. When Kostelanetz heard (through the New York City composer Joseph 
    V. DiMeo) that Lansky had developed a computer-assisted technique for apparently 
    altering the body quality of a voice, without destroying its individual identity, 
    Kostelanetz offered his text &quot;Wasting,&quot; which portrays through a 
    first-person narrator the changes in height and weight during the life of 
    an unusual human being. This was submitted to Lansky, who accepted it as suiting 
    his current designs, and then asked Kostelanetz to record the text in his 
    own voice. In part because of the challenge of creating so many unique acoustic 
    settings of essentially the same phrases, Lansky is involving his Princeton 
    graduate students in designing a multitude of appropriate solutions. If &quot;Wasting&quot; 
    succeeds, Kostelanetz and Lansky expect to be involved in other collaborations 
    as author and composer. ~(1985)~</p>

  <p>~A COMPOSITIONAL &quot;PARIS&quot; COMPARABLE TO ~NEW YORK CITY</p>
  <p>The composition, during an extended residency in Paris (under the US/France 
    Exchange Fellowship program), of an evening-length tape of &quot;music concrete&quot; 
    of and about the unique sounds of Paris, similar to the earlier composition, 
    likewise evening-length, initially commissioned by Westdeut|scher Rundfunk, 
    of and about sounds unique to New York City. Once field recordings in Paris 
    are made, probably in collaboration with Radio France, with which I have worked 
    before, they will be mixed not through an analogue tape system used for ~New 
    York City~ but though a more sophisticated, acoustically superior digital 
    system either at IRCAM, where I have contacts, or at the Electronic Music 
    Studio of Stockholm, where I have worked several times before and have, for 
    all practical purposes, a standing invitation. ~(1985)~</p>

  <p>~RESIDENCY IN EAST BERLIN FOR THE PURPOSE OF LEARNING GERMAN~</p>
  <p>May I propose spending two months in East Berlin, ideally May-June 1987, 
    studying German intensively. In my spare time, I plan to continue my research, 
    hopefully with growing linguistic competence, into the Great Jewish Cemetery 
    of Weissensee, East Berlin. In my judgment, this graveyard ranks among the 
    most extraordinary visual-verbal historical artifacts known to me. To quote 
    myself in an earlier essay, &quot;One reason perhaps why the cemetery is such 
    an evocative artifact now is that it remains unfamiliar to Berliners in both 
    the East and the West, each predisposed to forget about it for different reasons, 
    and unfamiliar as well, as I've discovered, to many prominent scholars of 
    the period.&quot; What I incidentally want to do during my stay in East Berlin 
    is continue photographing the cemetery, with slides toward an exhibition/installation 
    and black-and-white images toward a projected book. The best reason for doing 
    this in May-June is that the cemetery stays open later during those months, 
    when light sufficient for photography extends into the evening.</p>
  <p> The paradox of my linguistic history is that in working so much in German, 
    for German audiences, I never really learned to speak or read it. Instead, 
    I learned many German words and, perhaps more important, how to think from 
    the German point of view, as shown in several features written and produced 
    for German radio, mostly about the singular qualities of American radio culture. 
    Given all this work I have been doing in German, my inability to speak it 
    has become, in truth, a sort of standing joke among my colleagues, not just 
    there but here as well. My own calculation is that I can learn it better in 
    East Berlin than I did in West, if only because distractions will be fewer; 
    and then, unlike before, language-learning will become my principal mission. 
    Given how much German I already know and sense, a competence in reading and 
    speaking should come quickly, and it would be useful for further work, not 
    only on the cemetery, but in German media, surely in the West and perhaps, 
    once I live there, in the East as well. ~(1985)~</p>

  <p>~AUDIO ART: &quot;FENCING&quot;~</p>
  <p>An extended composition of and about the sound of fencing as the most acoustically 
    resonant sport. Recording matches from a variety of acoustic perspectives, 
    I want to make a radio piece that would fuse my earlier interest in compositions 
    ostensibly about the sound of their subjects (~Invocations~, ~New York City~, 
    &quot;Baseball&quot; in progress) with a newer notion of creating fictional 
    narratives exclusively with sound apart from speech. The resulting program 
    will probably have neither introduction nor narration; as it will not need 
    translation, it will be available for broadcast, as is, around the world.

  <p>~AN EXHIBITION OF &quot;LITERARY HOLOGRAPHY&quot;~</p>
  <p>Richard Kostelanetz has produced two holograms which differ from other holography 
    in that their entire visual content is language. The first, ~On Holography~ 
    (1978), is a revolving cylinder containing five syntactically circular statements 
    about holography itself. One technical detail that makes this film hologram 
    puzzling is that the five lines appear to revolve in unison, even though they 
    are of demonstrably different lengths. By itself, ~On Holography~ has previously 
    been exhibited in group shows at New York's Museum of Holography and elsewhere; 
    it was also included in Richard Kostelanetz's traveling retrospective, ~Wordsand~ 
    (1978-). The cylinder is 16 1/2&quot; in diameter, 9&quot; high and rests 
    on a revolving stand that is itself 17&quot; high. Accompanying it is an audiotape 
    of the same words in continuous loops; but while this audio complement can 
    aid comprehension, it need not be played constantly, if at all. The second 
    hologram, ~Antitheses~ (1985), is a two-sided framed glass, 10&quot; x 16&quot;, 
    hung in space, that contains opposing fields of complementary words, one side 
    suggesting warmth, the other cold, with antithetical words in typographic 
    pairs; and in each field, the words fall into four planes projecting forward 
    from the plate, optimally to points two feet in front of the plate (itself 
    a current state-of-the-art achievement). Although this pure hologram is ideally 
    laser-viewable, it can be displayed successfully with a halogen (white) lamp, 
    requiring at least ten feet of viewing space on each side; it is presently 
    installed in a structure of short poles, chains and Plexiglas mirrors that 
    is easily transportable. This will be exhibited at the Museum of Holography 
    in 1987. &quot;Literary Holography&quot; will be a small exhibition, easily 
    installed, that would inhabit a darkened space of roughly four hundred square 
    feet. Possible sponsors (museums, galleries, libraries) seriously wishing 
    to consider photographs or slides of the two extant holograms, as well as 
    an extended five-thousand-word essay about them, are advised to contact Kostelanetz. 
    These letters will accompany grant applications for initial expenses of crating, 
    catalogue production and perhaps the purchase/rental of a laser. ~(1985)~</p>

  <p>~AN EXTENDED RADIO PIECE OF/ABOUT JAMES JOYCE'S ~FINNEGANS WAKE</p>
  <p>Since Joyce's classic is composed of words from many languages, the initial 
    idea is to have the text read by superb readers native to various languages, 
    either in the original version or in &quot;translations&quot; published in 
    their languages; and these readings in various accents will be interwoven 
    into an aurally seamless rendition that will represent an ~international acoustic 
    interpretation~ of the ~Wake~'s unique style. As I now envision it, for most 
    of the work's duration, only one or a few of the many readers will be audible 
    at any time; they will fade in and out of one another. At certain climaxes, 
    many voices will join together. For convenience, it would be best to have 
    all the participating readers recite the complete &quot;Anna Livia Plurabelle&quot; 
    section, which runs twenty pages in the book and thus, in this aural format, 
    would take perhaps an hour. As Joyce himself recorded part of this text, it 
    would, of course, be good to incorporate his reading, if it can be made available, 
    into the final mix. I hope that participating radio stations in England, Canada, 
    America, Germany, Holland, France, Australia, Italy, Sweden, Denmark, Israel, 
    Spain, etc. will record their own best readers. These solo tapes will probably 
    be mixed at the Electro-Acoustic Music Studio of Stockholm, where I have worked 
    before, perhaps using its VAX computer system. In the history of my own work, 
    this proposed piece descends from ~The Eight Nights of Hanukah~ (CBC, 1983), 
    in which laymen native to two dozen different languages (and accents) are 
    heard reciting the same Hebrew prayer, and ~Invocations~, which reveals through 
    sixty ministers speaking twenty-four languages the unique sound of the language 
    of prayer. In this proposed ~Wake~ I expect to discover the international 
    sound of a text so multilingual it cannot be feasibly translated--a text whose 
    aural eloquence has universal, almost musical appeal. Since this project cannot 
    be completed overnight (and the work of analyzing the solo readings will take 
    at least a year), I hope now to marshal sufficient support to have the solo 
    tapes in hand by 1987 and the work complete by early 1989, when, remember, 
    we should celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the ~Wake~'s initial publication. 
    Producers at stations wishing to collaborate in this program of literature/radio 
    drama/speech-music (or to hear previous pieces, or to initiate a correspondence) 
    are invited to contact me. ~(1986)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p> Around leading personalities, it is true, judgments collect and create a 
    reputation independent of the paper file. But this comes late in the day, 
    usually when it is no longer needed; and reputation is hard to establish after 
    middle life, especially if the person is not a native and yet already on the 
    scene. I remember a foreign scholar, whose works were well known and whose 
    residence in this country for some ten years had made him many distinguished 
    admirers. He wanted after his retirement to finish a three-volume work in 
    an important branch of philosophy. The combined efforts of a dozen or more 
    high-placed American scholars were unavailing to obtain for this man the supplement 
    to his pension which would have given him three or four years of peace of 
    mind to finish his work. Every foundation was interested; innumerable letters 
    were filed. But when it came to the disbursement of twelve thousand dollars, 
    half a century's alienation from intellectual man interposed its veto.--Jacques 
    Barzun, ~The House of Intellect~ (1957)</p>
  <p>~A BOOK ON LITERARY GRANTING IN AMERICA~</p>
  <p>My projected book on literary granting in America, in progress for nearly 
    a decade, attempts to understand, in a historical and critical way, the new 
    world of publicly funded support of literature. Even though government funding 
    of the arts has blossomed from nearly nil to over $200 million within the 
    past twenty years, there has not been much systematic critical examination, 
    or even elementary demystification, at least in public print. This manuscript 
    has an introduction, an abridgment of which is enclosed, and then long (but 
    dated) chapters on the literature programs at the National Endowment for the 
    Arts and the largest state arts council (New York), in addition to critiques 
    of literary funding at the National Endowment for the Humanities and the former 
    principal subcontractor of NEA's literary funding, the Coordinating Council 
    of Literary Magazines. This manuscript has been written by someone who has 
    not only applied for grants from these organizations (and received support 
    from most of them) but also served as a grants panelist; for one assumption 
    is that the critic of granting is not likely to know what actually happened--is 
    not likely to understand either detail or nuance--unless he or she has applied 
    and judged, asking questions all along the way. People who regularly consult 
    me know that the processes of funding for the arts are no more mysterious 
    than art itself; they ~can~ be understood.</p>
  <p> My critical method depends largely upon the analysis of public evidence, 
    beginning with annual reports and including applications and internal documents, 
    rather than interview and rumor, and then upon illustrative contrasts, not 
    only because the examination of one agency or department often illuminates 
    another, but also because comparisons are entwined with my ultimate theme: 
    literary funding in the United States is ~not~ a monolithic operation, dominated 
    by a single &quot;establishment.&quot; In fact, these agencies differ from 
    one another, and even within a particular agency individual departments can 
    operate quite differently; and a change in leadership can often bring drastic 
    changes in granting policies. It can also be said that I scrupulously avoid 
    confusing politics with literary politics and granting policies (e.g., the 
    principal effect of Ronald Reagan's regime, for instance, has not been a favoring 
    of politically conservative artists, as feared, but budget tightening that 
    favors those who have previously succeeded, regardless of persuasion, to the 
    disadvantage of newcomers).</p>
  <p> My second theme is that these literature programs fail (and succeed) in 
    perceptibly different ways. The problems at the literature program at the 
    New York State Council on the Arts, for example, are not those of the literature 
    program at the National Endowment for the Arts, which in turn sometimes has 
    problems not evident at NYSCA. Some problems endemic at NYSCA-Literature, 
    in turn, are not present in other NYSCA departments, which in turn sometimes 
    have problems not known to its literature department. Even though I have found 
    blatant deficiencies of all sorts, some more serious than others, my conclusion 
    is not that governmental cultural funding is inevitably corrupt but quite 
    the opposite: Unless a corruption is evident in all of them, it need not be 
    present in any of them.</p>
  <p> A manuscript was completed in 1981; however, the small commercial publisher 
    contracting it the year before had folded by early 1982. As I had meanwhile 
    received the first of several stipends to work in Europe, this &quot;grants 
    book&quot; languished. Chapters appeared in ~ACM~, ~Smoke Signals~, ~Contact 
    II~, ~Soho Arts Weekley~, ~Home Planet News~, among other magazines. Constant 
    queries from colleagues (who have come to regard me as an authority on the 
    particularities of various funders), along with completion of that European 
    work, prompts me to return to the subject. That earlier manuscript needs updating, 
    as well as revision; its evidence and issues need to be reexamined, undistracted 
    by remunerative needs. No one known to me is examining these agencies as thoroughly 
    and critically; and perhaps because the results of such original research 
    will inevitably be controversial, it is not likely that anyone else will. 
    (Professional invulnerability is not common now.) May the resulting book advance 
    current understanding of American literary philanthropy as much as the first 
    half of my earlier book reportedly advanced our sense of native literary politics.

  <p>~BOOK: &quot;AN ABC OF CONTEMPORARY READING&quot;~</p>
  <p>It began as an extended critical essay, conceived and written as an update 
    to Ezra Pound's classic ~ABC~. Aphoristic in style, general in pitch, it intends 
    to define precisely and vividly certain innovative, remarkable characteristics 
    of contemporary experimental writing--a literature that is considerably different 
    from the &quot;new writing&quot; that Pound had in mind several decades ago. 
    Parts of this essay in progress have appeared in literary magazines and anthologies 
    over the past decade (e.g., ~NER/BLQ~ and Donald Hall's ~Claims for Poetry~). 
    Earlier versions of the whole have appeared in the periodicals ~Precisely~ 
    and ~Poetics Today~, along with my anthology ~Esthetics Contemporary~ (1978); 
    and these have frequently been acknowledged in writing by others.</p>
  <p> For the definitive book-length version, I expect to revise the entire text 
    once again, now on my word processor for final publication, reconsidering 
    each sentence, mostly with respect to recent writing, and probably adding 
    new sections. I long ago learned that my very best essays, especially about 
    literature, are those rewritten over several years (e.g., the introductions 
    to ~Twelve from the Sixties~ [on innovations in short fiction], ~The Yale 
    Gertrude Stein~, ~The New American Arts~, ~Possibilities of Poetry~). However, 
    the final ~ABC~ book will differ from the essay in this crucial conceptual 
    respect: while my text runs continuously on the right-hand (odd-numbered) 
    pages, on the left-hand (even-numbered) pages will continuously appear epigraphs, 
    examples and other relevant material as a kind of extended counterpoint to 
    my text. As the recipient of awards and fellowships for book-art and book-design, 
    I will design the final manuscript, which will run at least two hundred pages, 
    probably preparing camera-ready copy. I'd like to think that my ~ABC~ would 
    be particularly valuable not only to students of contemporary literature but 
    to aspiring writers, and that it might well be used in sophisticated courses 
    in these areas. Given its avant-garde thrust, may it perhaps be read for as 
    long as Pound's book has been read. ~(1986)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~ANOTHER RESIDENCY IN HOLOGRAPHY~</p>
  <p>On one hand, I know my material is language. On the other, I want to discover 
    in residencies what might be possible with those technologies, sometimes abetted 
    by the technician, made available to me and to realize within these possibilities 
    a language structure unique to that medium (or impossible in any other). Since 
    I've already done a film hologram and a transmission hologram, this time I 
    should like to make a reflection hologram.</p>
  <p> One conceptual idea in my mind now, given the description of material available 
    in your laboratory, would be an image broken apart into smaller pieces, probably 
    square or rectangular in shape; so that the viewer would discover through 
    different perspectives upon language the holographic truth about each part 
    containing the whole. Another theme (exemplified in my recent hologram ~Antitheses~, 
    1985) worth pursuing in another way would be that of forcing the viewer to 
    move his or her eyes, from side to side as well as up and down, in order to 
    see words initially visible only as indecipherable lines or words hidden behind 
    foreground words--to utilize structures of verbal-visual revelation best realized 
    in holography (though not so unique to it). I also look forward to discovering, 
    albeit with anxiety, what might be possible for me now in holography working, 
    unlike before, ~alone~ (mostly). Since I now have in my studio considerably 
    more audio equipment than before, I might also create a complementary audiotape 
    comparable to the one produced for ~On Holography~ (1978). ~(1986)~</p>

  <p>Each of these sentences is meant to be a complete autonomous fiction, without 
    any intentional connection to any other story in the manuscript. Thus, editors 
    are invited to select as many as they wish, and to publish those selections 
    in any order they wish, ideally separating one story from the others through 
    extra space (as here), hairlines, different typefaces or some other design 
    device(s). (Inventive design will be rewarded, surely in heaven, perhaps on 
    earth.) ~(1986)~</p>

  <p>~&quot;BERLINERISCH&quot;: A MULTILINGUAL AUDIO COMPOSITION~</p>
  <p>In the course of making our prize-winning film(s) about the great Jewish 
    cemetery of Berlin-Weissensee as the principal surviving reflection of pre-War 
    Berlin [titles listed], Martin Koerber and I have interviewed on audiotape 
    (with an Uher 4200, or a Sony D-6, accompanied by first-rate microphones) 
    elderly Berliners speaking about pre-WWII life in German, English, French 
    and Swedish, and we will interview soon in Hebrew and Spanish. Since the footage 
    we shot at the cemetery is silent, we selected from these audiotapes off-camera 
    testimony to produce different twenty-one-minute films in each of those languages. 
    (We did not overdub or use subtitled translations. Instead, we reproduced 
    the film in each language, using authentic testimony by Berliners speaking 
    each language.) From the German tapes alone we joined Michael Maassen in producing 
    a seventy-minute radio feature, ~Nach Weissensee~, initially aired in 1974 
    on RIAS (West Berlin).</p>
  <p> What we now propose to do is compose more unusual, experimental multitrack 
    audiotapes that would incorporate interviews in all these languages into a 
    grand mix not only about prewar Berlin but about the ur-sound of Berliners 
    speaking. The work would have the linguistic density of my composition about 
    the sound of the language of prayer, ~Invocations~, thus combining our initial 
    documentary purposes with imaginative-acoustic values. We could construct 
    a hypothetical score now, but think that inadvisable, as we have not yet gathered 
    all the testimony and, in truth, want to experiment with various mixes before 
    putting together the whole, which is how I customarily work with speech and 
    sound on compositions fundamentally about the unique acoustic qualities of 
    their subjects (e.g., ~New York City~ and ~Baseball: Americas' Game~). On 
    one hand, for instance, we want to present people saying complementary things 
    about Berlin in different languages, from different points in the stereo spectrum; 
    on the other hand, we want to explore semantic and sonic counterpoint.</p>
  <p> We could produce one tape of our &quot;Berlinerisch&quot; or, with sufficient 
    time and production budget, compose different polyglot versions, each emphasizing 
    one or another of the available languages, so that in one multilingual tape 
    French predominates, in another German predominates, in a third Swedish predominates, 
    etc., without eliminating the presence of five other tongues. (The technical 
    capability of &quot;mixing down&quot; from multitracked material makes this 
    feasible.) As these tapes will all be twenty minutes long, they could also 
    be shown with our film as a compositionally more sophisticated alternative 
    to the four (plus two) sound tracks already supported by Inter Nationes.</p>
  <p> It would be appropriate to complete this audio &quot;Berlinerisch&quot; 
    for the 750th anniversary of Berlin in 1987, perhaps as a ~new~ contribution 
    to WDR's Metropolis series, and for broadcast around the world at that time, 
    initially by stations previously airing Kostelanetz's audio art. In the course 
    of doing the original interviews, we obtained signed permission from the interviewees. 
    Enclosed, as samples of testimony, are the sound tracks of the English and 
    German films. ~(1986)~</p>

  <p>For the past decade, Richard Kostelanetz has composed complex extended audiotapes 
    integrating speech and sound, including ~Invocations~ (60 minutes, 1981, NEA-funded; 
    1984) and ~New York City~ (87 minutes, 1983; 60 minutes &amp; 140 minutes, 
    1984), that have been broadcast around the world. Invited to give presentations 
    and museum installations of these works (and objecting in principle to live 
    public concerts of tape alone), Kostelanetz has developed for the latter tape, 
    entirely on his own, a limited complementary slide accompaniment of only three 
    hundred images. (This has already been presented at venues in Belgium, Germany, 
    Mexico and Puerto Rico, in addition to the U.S. The most common criticism 
    is that the visual component hasnâ€™t yet equaled the acoustic.)</p>
  <p> What is proposed here is funding Kostelanetz to prepare the two thousand-plus 
    slides necessary for a multitrack visual component as rich and complicated 
    as his audio ~New York City~, and a thousand additional slides to accompany 
    similarly his other major audiotape, ~Invocations~. It is expected that these 
    slides will initially be used in the concerts and &quot;readings&quot; of 
    his work that Kostelanetz as an artist/writer/composer is frequently invited 
    to give around the world. They may also be used, with more sophisticated projection 
    techniques, in installations.</p>
  <p> Simply, the artist will try to find an abundance of images, everywhere in 
    his visual experience, that accompany his audiotapes. Remembering acoustic 
    episodes, he will seek out visual equivalences; other times, the visual element 
    will evolve thematic counterpoints. This could be compared to the filmmaking 
    process of preparing a visual track to a sound track that already exists (most 
    notably in Joseph Strick's production of James Joyce's ~Ulysses~); but since 
    the artist is initially interested in enhancing his ~live~ presentations, 
    filling up the performance space with several simultaneous and continuous 
    projections, much as his multitrack audiotape can fill the space acoustically, 
    slides would be the more appropriate (and more economical) visual medium. 
    The slides themselves will be both individual images, like those in the sample, 
    and photographic sequences like those in his book, ~Reincarnations~ (1981), 
    and his book-length fictional &quot;Recall,&quot; parts of which have appeared 
    in several magazines. Ideally, several tracks of imagery will be as rich and 
    complicated as his multitrack audiotapes. Though the work of photography could 
    be assigned to someone else, Kostelanetz thinks it important that, at least 
    for concerts of his work, he, as a multimedia artist, be responsible for the 
    visual accompaniment. To do it right he needs funding, because just as it 
    isn't worth doing unless it can be done right, so he shouldn't be continuing 
    his live ~New York City~ presentation in its present inferior form.</p>
  <p> It is possible that this work will lead to similar visual enhancements of 
    other extended audio tapes of his, including ~Relationships~ (1983) and ~Americas' 
    Game~ (1986, NEA-funded) and, beyond that, perhaps to the creation of new 
    performance works that from their beginning would be for both multitrack slides 
    and multitrack audiotape--presentational pieces that, in his case, would extend 
    and combine his work, for over a dozen years now, in visual fiction and acoustic 
    narrative, which is to say, as he frequently does, for literature other than 
    printed pages. No other electro-acoustic composer known to him is working 
    in this way (though more should, while his friend Reynold Weidenaar is setting 
    a strong example for video complements to his tape compositions). ~(1986)~</p>

  <p>~PERIODICAL PUBLICATION OF &quot;MORE OPENINGS &amp; CLOSINGS&quot;~</p>
  <p>These single-sentence stories are meant to be, alternately, the opening sentences 
    or closing sentences in otherwise nonexistent fictions. In this manuscript, 
    openings are in normal type, closings are in boldface. They should be similarly 
    differentiated in print with, say, the openings in italic type and the closings 
    in roman type, or the openings on the left-hand pages of two-page spreads 
    and the closings on the right-hand pages. (Inventive design is encouraged.) 
    As these fictions are autonomous, not all stories need be used, and they need 
    not be used in the order presented here, as no opening is necessarily connected 
    to any closing. This text supplements, without duplication, the &quot;Openings 
    &amp; Closings&quot; written a decade ago and like its predecessor could also 
    become the stuff of a book.</p>

  <p>~AN INTERRELATED SERIES OF VIDEOTAPES BASED UPON AUDIOTAPES OF SACRED TEXTS~</p>
  <p>including ~Invocations~ (funded by NEA-Media in 1981, 60 minutes), ~The Gospels~ 
    (also NEA-backed, 1982, 120 minutes), ~Die Evangelien~ (commissioned by Westdeutscher 
    Rundfunk, 1983, 60 minutes), ~The Eight Nights of Hanukah~ (commissioned by 
    the C.B, 1983, 5:30), ~The Gospels Abridged~ (1986, 60 minutes). My wish is 
    to explore the creation of kinetic imagery indigenous to video and yet appropriate 
    to the sacred texts (abstract, rather than anthropomorphic, because of the 
    proscription against graven images), and to assemble the pieces in ~hifi stereo 
    videotapes~ running from six hours in continuous length, thanks to the capability 
    of 1/2&quot; technology, down to shorter forms more appropriate for television 
    broadcast, initially by stations here and abroad that have previously aired 
    my work. Since the tapes themselves were produced in sophisticated electronic 
    music studios, their videos should be hi-fi stereo. In my opinion, they would 
    best be viewed, especially in exhibitions, on the first-rate video projection 
    system, such as the Kloss 100 or new Kloss 1000. A supplementary plan is to 
    make eight separate realizations of ~Praying to the Lord~ for eight small-screen 
    monitors.</p>
  <p> Out of the realization that concert performances of audiotape alone were 
    not sufficient, I became interested in adding visual elements to my sound 
    compositions, initially of slides for ~New York City~ (in presentations at 
    Pro Musica Nuova in Bremen and the University of Puerto Rico). Since I've 
    made films and videotapes apart from these audiotapes, it seemed appropriate 
    to produce visual tracks directly for these tapes, working initially in video, 
    but later in film, with the elements observing similar esthetic principles. 
    These proposed works would also extend the position, established most prominently 
    in our prize-winning polylingual films about prewar Berlin, about the value 
    of nonsync sound in the production of both films and videotapes. Incidentally, 
    the next films I would like to do would involve composing more representational 
    visual tracks to ~New York City~ and ~Americas' Game~ (1986, NEA-funded), 
    sound tracks to U. S. military aerial footage of Berlin in 1945 and, if appropriate 
    rights can be obtained, a video synthesis to James Joyce's historic recording 
    of passages from ~Finnegans Wake~. ~(1987)~</p>

  <p>~AN EXTENDED ARTICLE ABOUT THE BERLIN WALL~</p>
  <p>Though I've written about Berlin before, I have an idea for a piece I've 
    not done in the past (and haven't seen from anyone else). That would be an 
    elaborate discussion of ~Der Mauer~, which is the local name for the Berlin 
    Wall; it would at minimum touch upon the following topics:</p>
  <p>1. Its origins, evolution and and reasons for being, from both Western and 
    Eastern perspectives. (Remember that the East claims it was constructed to 
    prevent an invasion from the West. That accounts for why the uniformed soldiers 
    in the guard towers are constantly training their binoculars on the West.)</p>
  <p>2. What the Wall looks like, from both sides, with barbed wire and then open 
    space on the Eastern side and graffiti on the Western side. (I have marvelous 
    photographs of the latter.) In a recent ~Insight,~ you should know, was a 
    photograph captioned &quot;East Berliners Walking Beside the Wall,&quot; but 
    that would be impossible. East Berliners can't get anywhere near their side 
    of the Wall.</p>
  <p>3. Where it goes (and why), including its passing through the middle of a 
    lake or under an elevated subway. Here I would describe Steinstucken, which 
    is an enclave a few miles outside West Berlin but legally tied to it. Once 
    physically isolated from West Berlin, it is now connected by a road surrounded 
    by high walls on both sides.</p>
  <p>4. How to pass through it, both legally and illegally, from both West to 
    East and East to West. This would include a summary of the procedures for 
    three categories of Western visitors--West Berliners, West Germanys and &quot;andere 
    staten&quot;--as well as the East German rules on different categories of 
    their citizens traveling West. Here I would describe the Museum at Checkpoint 
    Charlie which documents some of the more elaborate escapes.</p>
  <p>5. How it is experienced, with testimony from both sides. My sense is that 
    West Berlin has been rebuilt to eliminate experience of the Wall. I know from 
    having lived there for nearly a year (in snatches) that you must be reminded 
    of the Wall's existence. Most West Berliners go about their daily business 
    without thinking about it and in general are scarcely affected by it, except 
    for certain subtle anomalies--in midsummer the city's streets are filled with 
    people, because nobody in West Berlin is ever invited to spend a boring weekend 
    at a country home.</p>
  <p>6. The mechanics of maintaining the Wall. Since it is on East German property, 
    they from time to time send over two guys with whitewash who clean off the 
    graffiti in the presence of two armed East soldiers, all of whom return to 
    the East. Also, not long ago, East policemen came through to arrest and take 
    back a West Berlin graffiti artist, and I heard that since he was captured 
    defacing East German property on East German territory there was nothing West 
    Berlin could do about rescuing him.</p>
  <p>7. I would like to do something with Heidelbergerstrasse in Neukolln, which 
    is one of the few places where West Berliners and East Berliners live in sight 
    of each other and, indeed, hang out on their windowsills talking to each other 
    over the East German protection space.</p>
  <p>8. The foolishness of Ronald Reagan's demand to &quot;tear down the Wall.&quot; 
    This gets us into legal differences on how each regards the other. To the 
    West, East Germany is a lost province. To the East, they are separate countries, 
    now and forever. Therefore, a telephone call from West to East is billed at 
    the same rate as a call within West Berlin. By contrast, a call from East 
    to West is billed as &quot;international.&quot; Therefore as well, East Germans 
    emigrating to West Germany are entitled to employment and welfare, without 
    discrimination. Were the Wall to come down tomorrow, there would be a flood 
    of East Germans expecting jobs and thus the probability of massive unemployment 
    in the West!</p>
  <p> I would expect this piece to be at least three thousand words long, preferably 
    five. Drawing upon my experience of Berlin, in addition to friends living 
    in both the West and the East, I want to write a rich picture of a unique 
    situation whose ramifications and implications can hardly be imagined until 
    you are there. Should you like to commission, please let me hear from you.

  <p> I'm so involved in trying to get things done, working or trying to move 
    things away from the clogged situation that exists now that I'm not really 
    involved with that issue.--Robert Morris (1971), interviewed by Lucy R. Lippard, 
    ~Six Years~ (1973)</p>
  <p>~AN AUDIO COMPOSITION &quot;BUENOS AIRES&quot; SIMILAR TO MY ~NEW YORK CITY</p>
  <p>What I hope to do during my Argentine Fulbright is compose an extended audiotape 
    of and about the sound of Buenos Aires similar to the one of and about ~New 
    York City~ (1984). This contributes to a series of extended audiotape compositions 
    of and about the sound of its subject--the language of prayer in ~Invocations~ 
    (60 minutes, 1981), baseball in ~Americas' Game~ (60 minutes, 1986), the Jewish 
    Diaspora in &quot;Kaddish&quot; (in progress, on commission from Westdeutscher 
    Rundfunk).</p>
  <p> This project would involve taking my own microphones and recording machines 
    around Buenos Aires to tape sounds that are as unique to that city as those 
    in my ~NYC~ are unique to my hometown, and from these Buenos Aires sounds 
    to make an equally elaborate audiotape composition, at my own expense, on 
    my own time, probably at studios elsewhere. (The most likely places are the 
    Electronic Music Studio of Stockholm and the Center for Computer Music at 
    Brooklyn College, both of which have awarded me residencies in the past.) 
    I would draw upon contacts made in the initial visit to Buenos Aires this 
    past June, as well as the advice of Francisco Kroepfel, the director of a 
    Buenos Aires electronic music studio, who has been officially commissioned 
    to compose a Buenos Aires in the same Westdeutscher Rundfunk series that commissioned 
    my ~NYC~. I expect that my portrait would fundamentally differ not only from 
    his but from my earlier work in that this time I would be approaching the 
    city as ~an outsider~. That last fact also makes the proposed project conceptually 
    more interesting to me. The &quot;Buenos Aires&quot; tape would become available 
    for broadcast and for concerts and, like earlier works of mine, for release 
    on disc or cassette. I would also probably write an extended essay about the 
    work, as is my custom, and thus about Buenos Aires; in that sense, the project 
    extends my earlier interest (also evident in the films about Berlin) in the 
    culture of cities. My title is tentative; the material, when complete, might 
    suggest another. ~(1987)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~AN ORIGINAL INSTALLATION COMBINING THREE EXTANT ELEMENTS ABOUT NEW YORK 
    CITY~</p>
  <p>The ~first~ would be a 90-minute audiocassette composed of and about sounds 
    unique to New York City. It draws upon a 60-minute work commissioned in 1983 
    by Westdeutscher Rundfunk for its &quot;Metropolis&quot; series. This &quot;International 
    Version&quot; of my ~New York City~ was broadcast the following year, rebroadcast 
    over public radio elsewhere around the world, and subsequently included in 
    the Audio Art section of Documenta 8 (1987). Approximately thirty minutes 
    of excerpts from it ran, in alternation with another tape, as a continuous 
    sound track during an exhibition devoted to 42nd Street at the Whitney Museum 
    at Philip Morris in 1984.</p>
  <p> What I propose to do for the Brooklyn Bridge Anchorage is compose, during 
    my next residency at the Electro-Acoustic Music Studio of Stockholm (May 1988), 
    a 90-minute hi-fi (metal tape) stereo ~American~ version, including new elements, 
    some based upon the sound of the Brooklyn Bridge. Back at the Anchorage, this 
    tape would be run continuously from a cassette player on the premises, its 
    sound channeled to two loudspeakers installed on opposite walls (~not~ opposite 
    ends) of the most southwest vault--a space so resonant acoustically that I 
    figure two speakers would be sufficient. My principal reason for selecting 
    that vault, among the available spaces, is that it has not only the greatest 
    acoustic resonance but also the largest amount of ambient N.Y. noise, creating 
    the preconditions for an aleatory &quot;mixing&quot; of my composition of 
    natural sounds with not only echoes of itself but the real &quot;outside&quot; 
    stuff, so to speak. This vault is also sufficiently distant from the other 
    vaults not to disturb them.</p>
  <p> A ~second~ element for the Anchorage installation would be two sequences 
    of 240 slides of photographic images unique to N.Y., each projected continuously 
    (but nonsynchronously), one sequence above the other, onto a large cloth, 
    taller than it is wide, on the west wall of the vault. These were prepared 
    as a visual accompaniment for concerts of the tape and already have been shown 
    several times outside NYC.</p>
  <p> A ~third~ element, made specifically for the Anchorage installation, would 
    be a continuous projection onto the east wall of slides of eighty images from 
    &quot;Recall,&quot; which has twenty-image and forty-image sequences of systematic 
    recompositions of a single classic photograph of the Brooklyn Bridge. Parts 
    of this last work have appeared in cultural magazines, but never before has 
    it been exhibited in New York City. ~(1987)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~BOOK ANTHOLOGY: &quot;THE LIBERTARIAN TRADITION: AMERICAN ANARCHIST THOUGHT&quot;~</p>
  <p>When a colleague told me that there were no anthologies of anarchist-libertarian 
    thought currently in print, it seemed opportune to propose to do one that 
    I've been thinking about for years, an anthology that would differ from those 
    available before, and be perhaps more relevant now, precisely by (1) focusing 
    wholly upon American thinkers and (2) combining proponents of the libertarianism 
    (&quot;right&quot;) with anarchism (&quot;left&quot;). Remembering Peter Kropotkin's 
    comment that Josiah Warren's brand of anarchism seemed peculiar to America, 
    I would try to establish in my extended introduction the Americanness of the 
    selections and of the mix. Otherwise, I envision a book at least 320 pages 
    long, and among the historical contributors would be Henry David Thoreau, 
    Josiah Warren, Benjamin R. Tucker, Stephen Pearl Andrews, Adin Ballou, Lysander 
    Spooner, Albert Jay Nock and Emma Goldman. From contemporaries I would expect 
    to select choice works by Dwight Macdonald (&quot;The Root Is Man&quot;), 
    Kenneth Rexroth, Paul Goodman (&quot;The Black Flag of Anarchism&quot;), Karl 
    Hess (&quot;The Death of Politics&quot;), John Cage, Robert Nozick, Thomas 
    Sowell, Ayn Rand, Thomas Szasz, Murray Rothbard, Dorothy Day, and Murray Bookchin 
    (&quot;Post-Scarcity Anarchism&quot;). The book would close with a bibliography 
    of further readings. In structure and polemical thrust, &quot;The Libertarian 
    Tradition&quot; would resemble the anthologies of futuristic social thought 
    (~Beyond Left &amp; Right~, ~Social Speculations~, ~Human Alternatives~, ~The 
    Edge of Adaptation~) that I did for commercial publishers over a dozen years 
    ago. If only because we are reaching in America now the edge of widespread 
    change in our ways of thinking about politics, I'd like to believe that 1988 
    would be a propitious time to publish &quot;The Libertarian Tradition.&quot; 
    ~(1987)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~A COLLECTION OF ESSAYS ON &quot;THE NEW POETRIES AND SOME OLD&quot;~</p>
  <p>This would be a direct sequel to ~The Old Poetries and the New~ (Univ. of 
    Michigan, 1981), which was by far the most radical contribution to Donald 
    Hall's series &quot;Poets on Poetry,&quot; and also a supplement to ~The Old 
    Fictions and the New~ (McFarland, 1987). The proposed book would collect essays 
    of mine on poetry, most of them written in the past decade--essays that, but 
    for a few exceptions, have not appeared in any other books published under 
    my name. It would begin with extended comprehensive profiles of two major 
    North American poetry theorists, Northrop Frye and Kenneth Burke. Next would 
    come a short appreciation of Marianne Moore (as a precursor), a laudatory 
    review of Grant Webster's masterful book on American criticism (~The Republic 
    of Letters~) and two devastating reviews of conservative poetries, exemplified 
    by the academics collected in Stephen Berg's anthology ~Singular Voices~ and 
    then by Joseph Brodsky. A final piece in the opening section would be my long 
    retrospective consideration of anthologies and anthologizing. The second part 
    would begin with a short general introduction to &quot;Avant-Garde Poetry 
    in America Now,&quot; distinguishing those who would purify the materials 
    of poetry from those who would mix it with concerns and materials from the 
    other arts. Along the first theme would be my introduction to Harry Polkinhorn's 
    ~Anaesthesia~ and my extended interview with John Cage about his ~Finnegans 
    Wake~ project. Next would come &quot;The Literature of SoHo,&quot; a reconsideration 
    of text-sound in North America (extending the much-reprinted essay in the 
    earlier volume), and &quot;Literary Videotapes,&quot; in addition to the texts 
    of two symposia moderated by me: one on visual poetry, the other on sound 
    poetry. The final section would have statements about my own poetry, including 
    the prefaces to ~Turfs, etc.~ and &quot;Duets, Trios and Choruses&quot; and 
    the manifestos &quot;Why Audio Drama Now&quot; and &quot;Literary Holography.&quot; 
    I'd like to think that these essays establish not only the most substantial 
    radical foundation for regarding American poetry today but sharp understanding 
    of specific issues. Contracting it soon would no doubt inspire further writing 
    and rewriting. ~(1987)~</p>

  <p>~ONE DOZEN BOOK-ART BOOKS LONG IN PROGRESS~</p>
  <p>Support would go toward the completion, design and production (all by the 
    artist, working by himself) in modest editions of several ~book-art books~ 
    long in progress, including, among others:<br />
    1. Two more books of constructivist short fictions (composed of line drawings 
    that metamorphose in systemic sequence).<br />
    2. A constructivist novel with 392 images in systemic sequence, to be entitled 
    &quot;Symmetries,&quot; to be printed in a format 4&quot; high x 14&quot; 
    wide.<br />
    3. A novel composed of interwoven constructivist sequences, titled &quot;Intermix.&quot;<br />
    4. A concluding collection of poems and fictions composed entirely of numbers.<br />
    5. &quot;Epiphanies,&quot; which are single-sentence stories meant to be the 
    climax moments in otherwise nonexistent stories and would be published in 
    a spacious format of only a few to a page.<br />
    6. &quot;More Openings &amp; Closings,&quot; which are either the opening 
    sentences of otherwise nonexistent fictions or the closing sentences and which 
    would thus be a sequel to the earlier book of the same title.<br />
    7. &quot;Shorter Stories,&quot; which are single-sentence stories different 
    from the others already described in that they are meant to be read as complete 
    stories.<br />
    8. &quot;Minimal Fictions,&quot; which are stories no more than three words 
    in length.<br />
    9. &quot;Strings,&quot; which are extended linguistic structures composed 
    of overlapping words, designed to be published on continuous paper, such as 
    adding machine tape.<br />
    10. &quot;Portraits from Memory,&quot; a sequence of 192 visual poems.<br />
    11. &quot;Recall,&quot; several sequences of a systemically recomposed photograph 
    of the Brooklyn Bridge, most of which have previously appeared in art and 
    literary magazines.</p>

  <p>~A CRITICAL BOOK ON &quot;SPECIAL SOUNDS: THE ART OF RADIO IN NORTH AMERICA&quot;~</p>
  <p>There have been several histories of radio in America, but what distinguishes 
    this book, in progress for most of the decade, is an emphasis upon ~artistic 
    achievement~ by Americans, from the 1920s to the present. &quot;Special Sounds&quot; 
    will have an introduction, yet unwritten, about issues and problems in radio 
    criticism, in part to praise such distinguished books as Rudolf Arnheim's 
    ~Radio: An Art of Sound~ (1937) but also to lament the absence of the kind 
    of extended considerations we've come to associate with a mature art. Otherwise, 
    the chapters will be drawn from talks initially done as features for European 
    radio, some of which have appeared in print here in literary magazines:</p>
  <p>1. The American Tradition of Radio Drama, which suggests that in contrast 
    to Europe our best radio theater is vernacular (e.g., radio comedy).<br />
    2. Audio Comedy in America Today, which argues that since 1952 the best radio 
    art, including comedy, appeared first on record;<br />
    3. New York City Radio, which explains narrow-casting and appreciates variety;<br />
    4. Glenn Gould as a Radio Artist, which introduces the compositions of speech 
    and sound that the great Canadian pianist produced from 1967 to his death;<br />
    5. John Cage as Horspielmacher, which traces his involvements with audiotapes 
    and radio from ~Williams Mix~ through the famous ~Roaratorio~;<br />
    6. American Sounds in Germany, which introduces the extraordinary, and extraordinarily 
    successful, radio produced by Americans working in the 1980s for German stations;<br />
    7. Tony Schwartz and One-Minute Audio Art, which elaborates the thesis, mentioned 
    elsewhere, that the best art produced nowadays directly for radio, rather 
    than record, appears in abbreviated forms (i.e., commercials);<br />
    8. Orson Welles as an Audio Artist, emphasizing his development prior to ~War 
    of the Worlds~ and the acoustic bases of his two earliest full-length films;<br />
    9. Norman Corwin, the &quot;Poet Laureate&quot; of radio, emphasizing programs 
    he wrote and produced in the early 1940s;<br />
    10. The funding of quality radio in America, which explains to Europeans how 
    radio art is produced here by stations lacking funds;<br />
    11. ~Texts and Proposals for Radio~, which is a survey of my own work.</p>
  <p> The essays appeared here in magazines ranging from the ~New York Times~ 
    to ~North American Review~. Any book publisher wishing to know more should 
    contact the author. ~(1987)~</p>

  <p>~COLLABORATION BETWEEN NOAH CRESHEVSKY (MUSIC) &amp; RICHARD KOSTELANETZ 
    (TEXT)~</p>
  <p>Noan Creshevsky is a composer, now associate professor of music at CUNY's 
    Brooklyn College, who has worked creatively with texts for over a decade. 
    Among the recent acknowledgments of his significance has been a personal entry 
    in ~The New Grove Dictionary of Music in the United States~, a copy of which 
    is enclosed, as a kind of resume. Enclosed also is a copy of the score of 
    his recent work, ~Crosstalk~, which is based on a text by John Cage. Creshevsky's 
    radical notion here is that the literary text provides not just the source 
    but the principal score for exclusively musical interpretation. As Creshevsky 
    advises, &quot;Syllables and words appearing in the parts indicate precisely 
    synchronous rhythmic and inflective instrumental sounds. In rehearsal, sentences 
    should first be read in the style and tempo selected by the group. Players 
    then match sounds to the syllables and words appearing in his/her part. No 
    words are heard in [final] performance; they are a 'ghost text' for rehearsal 
    purposes only.&quot; He continues, &quot;The eventual subtraction of text 
    neither detracts from the players' familiarity with the stories' contents, 
    nor with their continuing obligation to reproduce sounds which remain, rhythmically 
    at least, faithful to the original text. Among [the performers'] principal 
    aims will be the wish to demonstrate the versatility and beauty of their instruments 
    in conjunction with their own skill and ingenuity as performers.&quot;</p>
  <p> Richard Kostelanetz has produced experimental fictions and poetry for nearly 
    two decades now. This work has been included in many anthologies, among them 
    the ~Norton Introduction to Literature~ (1973) and ~The Treasury of American 
    Poetry~ (1978), and acknowledged as well in standard histories of American 
    literature. One of his continuing interests is providing unconventional texts 
    for experimental composers, including so far Charles Dodge, Paul Lansky, Bruce 
    Kushnick, Francis Schwartz and Philip Glass; and the results of these collaborations 
    have been broadcast around the world. Here he regards his contribution as 
    not only providing the text most suitable to the composer's designs, but also 
    collaborating on the work's realization and then its distribution, to radio 
    stations, on records and in concerts, which will probably include the display 
    visually, via slides, of the &quot;ghost text&quot; acknowledged in Creshevsky's 
    plan.</p>
  <p> What is proposed is supporting their collaborative realization of a new 
    audio work, based perhaps upon a new Kostelanetz text written especially for 
    the collaboration, in which the stylistic tastes and artistic backgrounds 
    of each will have a determining effect. ~(1986)~</p>

  <p>~AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL VIDEOTAPE ABOUT &quot;WRITING IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL AGE&quot;~</p>
  <p>Having done a traveling retrospective exhibition for university galleries 
    and also written illustrated retrospectives about my writing in several media 
    for magazines like ~Leonardo~, in addition to producing a survey on audiotape 
    about my &quot;Audio Writing&quot; for broadcast around the world and both 
    writing and narrating a video introduction to sound poetry and visual poetry 
    for CBS Camera Three (1974), I've thought much and long about the use of media 
    in portraying innovative literary evolution. Since my own &quot;writing&quot; 
    by now includes not only poetry, fiction and experimental prose for print, 
    but the use of language in silkscreened prints and canvases for gallery exhibitions 
    and then in book-art books, in audiotape compositions, videotapes, films and 
    even holograms, it would be appropriate for me to compose a self-retrospective 
    for videotape, not only for broadcast over public television stations, but 
    for private viewing in libraries and similar venues. Whereas the previous 
    retrospectives have been organized around my explorations, the new one would 
    focus upon my involvement with a succession of technologies for inscribing 
    language, beginning with the pencil (which is more useful than pricking one's 
    finger for making marks on paper) and progressing through the typewriter, 
    the electronic typewriter, the word processor, large format paper (for silk-screened 
    prints) and then the new technologies of audiotape, videotape, film and holography. 
    Tracing the evolution of my use of language in these media, I will describe 
    the problems posed by each, identifying advantages and disadvantages, while 
    showing examples along the way. (I may use the work of others, in addition 
    to my own.) Since my work involves both image and sound, and includes time-based 
    media, it seems obvious that the most propitious medium for documenting all 
    this would be one-inch videotape; and since my arts include video production, 
    I would produce this myself. Not unlike others involved with radical innovation 
    in writing, I've always been my own best popularizer.</p>
  <p> Since my creative work itself represents such a drastic departure from what 
    other &quot;writers&quot; are doing (and has been commonly regarded as unique 
    in this way, for well over a decade now), this documentary should be similarly 
    different from other literary documentation on film or videotape; and since 
    it will be done by the artist himself, I will be free to eschew all concessions 
    to convention. The first departure will be an emphasis upon the work, and 
    the history and sensibility behind it, even to the point of excluding the 
    author/artist from appearing full-face on the screen. There is no convention 
    of documentary filmmaking I despise more than the talking head (because it 
    confuses work with personality and lends itself to the making of untenable 
    and egotistical claims); and since this film is controlled by me, I can assure 
    in advance, not just the artist but everyone else, that that will not happen. 
    Instead, there will be an emphasis upon creative process and upon perception. 
    One model in my own mind is the portrayal of &quot;cut-up writing&quot; in 
    Howard Bookner's recent ~Burroughs~. Though I will hire a professional videographer, 
    whose ideas for filming I intend to respect, I will write the film and do 
    the narration, in addition to recording colleagues talking about the work. 
    (They're likely to be more specific and critical with me than they would be 
    in addressing a fawning filmmaker!) Need I say that I know of no precedent 
    for this, neither conceptually nor stylistically; and that fact alone should 
    earn it attention. Given the amount and variety of work to be covered, &quot;Writing 
    in the Technological Age&quot; should be 57 minutes long. Since most of the 
    visual track would be made apart from the sound, it would be easy to overdub 
    for television abroad. As most of work will involve only two professionals, 
    and travel will be minimal, my estimate for a total budget would be less than 
    fifty thousand dollars; the project should take at least six months to complete.

  <p> Men never cling to their dreams with such tenacity as at the moment when 
    they are losing faith in them, and know it, but do not dare yet to confess 
    it to themselves.--William Graham Sumner, ~The Banquet of Life~ (1887)</p>
  <p>~RADIO PRODUCTIONS~</p>
  <p>1. &quot;The Olympics of Sports Talk&quot;: The original idea for ~Invocations~ 
    was to record an international collection of sports announcers: to discover 
    whether they could be heard to sound alike, notwithstanding differences in 
    language--<br />
    whether there is a sound unique to the profession and that kind of communication. 
    That hypothesis fell away in favor of ministers articulating sound indigenous 
    to the language of prayer. Nonetheless, the original idea is still a good 
    one; and given the success of ~Invocations~ (broadcast around the world, available 
    here on record), it would be opportune to return to it for the Olympic year 
    of 1988. Westdeutscher Rundfunk has expressed interest in sponsoring this; 
    but since other commissions from WDR are unfinished, a grant from the NEA 
    would have the practical advantage of getting them on the stick over this. 
    (A precedent for this would be their support of ~The Gospels/Die Evangelien~, 
    in response to NEA funding in 1982.) &quot;The Olympics of Sports Talk&quot; 
    would probably be produced at the twenty-four-track analogue installation 
    of the Electro-Acoustic Music Studio of Stockholm, where ~Invocations~ was 
    made. Like its predecessor, which has so many languages it need not be &quot;translated&quot; 
    into any of them, this is designed to be broadcast, as is, around the world.</p>
  <p>2. An extended, yet untitled composition of and about the sounds unique to 
    various sports, including basketball (with its squeaky shoes), fencing, squash, 
    hockey, etc. Recording competitive matches from a variety of acoustic perspectives, 
    I want to make radio art that would fuse my earlier interest in compositions 
    ostensibly about the sound of their subjects (~Invocations~, ~New York City~, 
    ~Baseball: Americas' Game~) with a newer notion of creating fictions exclusively 
    with sound (apart from narrative speech). The resulting multitrack compositions, 
    probably an hour long in sum, will have neither introduction nor narration; 
    as they too will not need translation, they too will be available for broadcast, 
    as is, around the world.</p>
  <p>3. The reproduction of definitive sixty-minute ~English~ versions of five 
    major features about radio/audio art initially produced for German radio: 
    (a) &quot;The American Tradition of Radio Drama,&quot; first done for the 
    HÃ¶rspiel department of Westdeutscher Rundfunk in 1982 (and rebroadcast elsewhere 
    in Germany), argues (with choice examples) that the best radio drama produced 
    in this country has not been literary, on the European model, but vernacular, 
    and then that the master radio comedians discovered the unique dramatic possibilities 
    of radio. (This is the precursor to &quot;Audio Comedy in America Today,&quot; 
    done under an earlier NEA grant, and rebroadcast in Germany by WDR.) Since 
    I've gotten better at producing such features in the past five years (and 
    smarter about my subject as well), this should be considerably better than 
    the German original and may hopefully become a persuasive reason for reproducing 
    it. (b) &quot;Rudolf Arnheim on Radio,&quot; reproducing in our original English 
    an interview initially broadcast in German for WDR-HÃ¶rspiel (under an earlier 
    NEA grant), about the prominent esthetician-psychologist's pioneering book, 
    ~Radio: An Art of Sound~ (1937). (c) &quot;A Portrait of New York City Radio,&quot; 
    initially written for the features department of Sender Freies Berlin, focuses 
    upon what distinguishes American radio from European, beginning with the abundance 
    of stations across the dial and, also in contrast to Europe, the absence of 
    a published comprehensive radio schedule analogous to ~TV Guide~. (d) &quot;The 
    Audio Art of Orson Welles,&quot; which will first trace his radio career as 
    it leads up to ~War of the Worlds~ (1938) and then define the developments 
    that presage his films, not only ~The Magnificent Ambersons~, which, don't 
    forget, began as a 1939 radio play, but ~Citizen Kane~, whose sound track 
    is so evocative it was recently issued here on record. (e) &quot;Tony Schwartz's 
    One-Minute Radio Art,&quot; initially done in a rough form for German overdubbing 
    by WDR (1987), features the best work of one of our most prolific and distinguished 
    independent producers of commercials, interviewing him about his extraordinary 
    career and rich ideas. As I have realized in Europe a unique career of producing 
    features about the very best American radio art, doesn't everyone think it 
    would be nice to make them available for broadcast here? So far the intelligence 
    behind these features has appeared in English mostly in (silent) magazine 
    articles!</p>
  <p>4. The production of wholly fresh radio features about (a) &quot;John Cage 
    as a Radio Artist,&quot; based upon a critical essay written on a grant from 
    NYSCA Media Services and an interview to appear soon in ~The Musical Quarterly~. 
    This feature would draw not only upon the interview but upon copies of Cage's 
    radio pieces obtained directly from their principal producer--the HÃ¶rspiel 
    department of WDR. (Most are not yet publicly available.) This will be a sequel 
    to &quot;Glenn Gould as a Radio Artist,&quot; likewise a commentary with examples, 
    which was produced under a previous NEA grant and already rebroadcast in Germany, 
    Austria and Australia. (b) &quot;The Funding of Quality Radio in America,&quot; 
    which stems from repeated attempts to explain to colleagues in European radio 
    the American way of support (and nonsupport). There, stations produce and 
    subsidize quality radio. Here, as most commercial stations recycle records, 
    while public stations have limited production budgets and facilities, quality 
    audio is mostly produced outside radio contexts, with funds obtained from 
    sources other than radio stations (NEA, private foundations with special interests, 
    etc.) and then largely distributed gratis. Further contrasts are developed, 
    always with European examples in mind. Supplementing the commentary will be 
    examples of quality radio and interviews with those involved. If category 
    #3 here is for reproduction in English of what already has been done in other 
    languages, this section requests support for the production of English-language 
    masters that, as in the prior example of the Glenn Gould feature, would facilitate 
    subsequent reproduction into other languages. My work in European and American 
    radio should ideally run along a two-way street free of potholes and other 
    barriers. Needless to say perhaps, what I've been patiently working up for 
    the past decade, program by program, is a series, for broadcast here as well 
    as abroad, about &quot;The Art of Radio in North America&quot; that would 
    differ from previous surveys in emphasizing our highest artistic achievements.</p>
  <p> What is requested, please, is sufficient support to complete ~all~, rather 
    than some, of these proposals, most of which represent extensions of earlier 
    successful work, some of which have been &quot;in progress&quot; for years 
    (and years, alas). I hope there will be no need to offer them again, for in 
    1989 I would like to begin a new phase with an elaborate composition for the 
    fiftieth anniversary of the initial publication of James Joyce's ~Finnegans 
    Wake~. ~(1987)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~A FILM ABOUT &quot;THE NADIR OF THE CITY: BERLIN, APRIL 1945&quot;~</p>
  <p>The method of my previous prize-winning documentary, ~A Berlin Lost~ (made 
    in collaboration with Martin Koerber in 1984), was to film a visual representation 
    of a city's greatest years, in this case the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Weissensee, 
    and then compose a sound track about the life represented in the footage. 
    Since the interviewees, all Berliners, never appear on-screen, we were able 
    to produce fresh sound-tracks, wholly composed of authentic testimony, in 
    German, French, Spanish, Swedish and Hebrew, as well as English. For a sequel 
    about the nadir of a city, again Berlin, I wish to take the extraordinary 
    evocative aerial footage that American airmen shot of Berlin in April 1945, 
    showing, unlike no other footage known to me, a modern city in ruins. To this 
    footage, which is available in both color and black-and-white from the U.S. 
    government merely for the cost of copying, I may add footage and/or stills 
    gathered from other sources and/or enhanced by optical processing. (I would 
    avoid footage showing people, for they look like normal people, while Berlin 
    at that time scarcely resembles any city we know.) Once the visual track is 
    composed, I shall interview surviving Berliners about this brief period, after 
    the bombing but just before the arrival of the Allied forces. Since these 
    interviewees never appear on-screen, here, as in the previous film, authentic 
    testimony can be gathered in any language that Berliners speak--German, English, 
    Russian, French, etc. Thus alternate films can be made wholly in those languages, 
    with a minimal of subtitling or overdubbing. In the course of making ~A Berlin 
    Lost~, I heard several interviewees speak of this period in terms that were 
    not only stark but unfamiliar to me, testifying as they did to human ingenuity 
    in the face of devastation; and when I saw the aerial footage, I realized 
    that the combination of the two would make of this unique historical moment 
    a film that would not only echo its predecessor (in such stylistic characteristics 
    as nonsync sound) but would be valuable in itself. The film proposed here 
    would probably run between twenty and forty minutes; ideally, in tours it 
    would be shown with the other. Since the moment portrayed was over forty years 
    ago, it would be good to do it soon. ~(1988)~</p>

  <p> Our wishes lengthen as our sun declines.--Edward Young, ~Night Thoughts~ 
    (1742)</p>
  <p>~AN AUDIO REALIZATION OF &quot;LOVINGS&quot;~</p>
  <p>&quot;Lovings&quot; is a collection of independent single-sentence stories 
    about the variousness of love; parts have appeared in many literary magazines 
    and the whole text will eventually appear as a book. Though the stories are 
    meant to be appreciated separately, reading the entire text creates an aura 
    of intense erotic experience. To achieve this last effect on audiotape, let 
    me propose that the stories be read by several voices in a multitrack studio 
    in the following manner. One story is recorded in a tape-delay system that 
    allows for immediate echo, so that this first story is repeated continuously 
    until its decay. Once this first story is heard for a second time,that becomes 
    the cue for a second story to be read into the same tape-delay system, its 
    echo decaying on a separate track of the multitrack. Once this second story 
    is heard for the second time, a third story is read to echo on a third track. 
    This painstaking system is continued for however many stories will be read, 
    using as many tracks as are available. As the single-sentence stories tend 
    to run between six and ten seconds; the realization of a hundred of them will 
    take from twenty to thirty-four minutes. I should like to do as many as would 
    produce a tape lasting nearly one hour. In the mixdown (to either two-track 
    for record or eight-track for theatrical performance), there would be an attempt 
    to separate successive voices across the stereo spectrum. It is also possible 
    (if, say, this was composed in a foreign country where English-speaking readers 
    were scarce) that all the voices would be mine. My sense of the experience 
    of the piece is that new stories would be heard against a continuously recomposing 
    background bed of previous stories and thus, that though the stories be different, 
    the tone would be continuously and intensely erotic. ~(1988)~</p>

  <p>~AN AUDIOTAPE COMPOSITION OF AND ABOUT THE SOUND OF NEW YORK CITY SPEECH~</p>
  <p>People commonly speak of a New York accent, but those of us more familiar 
    with the sound of my hometown know there are many accents indigenous to N.Y., 
    each reflective of different ethnic groups, different boroughs, different 
    social classes and different years of birth. For this audiotape composition 
    I plan to record at least one hundred native New Yorkers who have lived here 
    most of their lives, saying, &quot;I was born in New York City in [year]&quot; 
    and then adding where their parents came from, in what neighborhoods they 
    grew up, perhaps where they went to schools, etc. My expectation is that from 
    these field recordings I will compose a piece of speech-music that will begin 
    as a sequence of solos, ordered not only for chronological exposition and 
    sociological intelligence but for sonic values. I imagine that voices will 
    quickly come up over one another (as New Yorkers are wont to do) from different 
    parts of the stereo spectrum; but before long, they will be heard speaking 
    in duets, electronically mixed and stereophonically arrayed, and then trios, 
    quartets and quintets, as I hope to find in choral arrangements a New York 
    City sound that would not be so audible in one voice alone. There is no need 
    to use any acoustic processing or any sounds other than native voices. I envision 
    a multitrack piece that would be at least thirty and perhaps sixty minutes 
    long. &quot;I Was Born in New York City&quot; will hopefully take its place 
    beside other extended audiotapes of mine that were composed of and about the 
    sound of a certain subjects--baseball (1986), New York City (1984), the Jewish 
    Diaspora (1983) and the language of prayer (1981)--and if this new piece turns 
    out as well as its predecessors, it should be permanently installed in the 
    waiting room of, say, Grand Central Station, welcoming visitors to the kind 
    of speaking they can expect to hear in New York City. I would need a few months 
    to consider the raw tapes and perhaps forty hours in multitrack studio to 
    compose it. ~(1988)~</p>

  <p>One of the gravest responsibilities of the modern State that it has not maintained

    the Intellectuals~ (1927)</p>
  <p>~TEACHING SEMINAR PROPOSALS~</p>
  <p>1. A year-long seminar in the &quot;Production of a Book,&quot; which would 
    include not only the writing (or equivalent production) of a book-length manuscript 
    but copyediting, design and production, by any means available to the student, 
    of a camera-ready dummy. Since I believe that, once you think in terms of 
    doing a book, certain problems are common, this course would be open to those 
    wishing to produce book-length manuscripts of poetry as well as fiction, visual 
    books (of photographs or related drawings) as well as nonfiction. Participants 
    would make copies of works in progress available to one another for criticism 
    and comment throughout the course of the year. (Now that I've produced some 
    books, I wish I had myself taken such a course as an undergraduate.)</p>
  <p>2. A one-semester (preferably spring) seminar in the Production of &quot;Major 
    Art Projects,&quot; open to practitioners of all arts, including writing, 
    where the requirement is simply the creation of major artwork, representing 
    the sum of all the student has learned, plus intensive labor. The emphasis 
    will be on learning how to think like a professional artist rather than mastering 
    the strategies of a discipline. I believe that though the techniques of the 
    various arts may differ, the production of art involves common problems and 
    that working alongside people in arts other than your own has two advantages--an 
    increase in general intelligence about art and a decrease in feelings of specific 
    competition. Readings and other research will be individually prescribed to 
    suit the needs of each student.</p>
  <p>3. A one-semester (preferably fall) seminar in &quot;Experimental Writing,&quot; 
    which would require students to produce work with reference to literature 
    that is radically unlike anything they or I have seen before. This is designed 
    to stretch imaginations, forcing students to produce work well beyond what 
    they have done, or thought they could do, when they began the course. Readings 
    will include anthologies edited by me: ~Imaged Words &amp; Worded Images~ 
    (1970), ~Future's Fictions~ (1971), ~Breakthrough Fictioneers~ (1973), ~Essaying 
    Essays~ (1975), ~Scenarios~ (1980), ~Text-Sound Texts~ (1980) and ~The Avant-Garde 
    Tradition in Literature~ (1982), which will function as catalogues of recent 
    innovations that need no longer be done.</p>
  <p>4. A one-semester seminar in the writing of &quot;Arts Criticism,&quot; with 
    an emphasis upon ~writing~ and thus open to critical aspirants of all arts. 
    Different though the arts are, I find that, once you become familiar with 
    one and develop esthetic principles, the problems of writing criticism are 
    fundamentally similar. Students will be required to write different kinds 
    of essays (monographs as well as reviews), with different approaches (description 
    as well as opinion), making copies for one another to criticize, not only 
    as editors but as colleagues; work will conclude with each student writing 
    an extended critical essay. Here too readings for students will be recommended 
    individually.</p>
  <p>5. A one-semester seminar in the &quot;Write of Arting,&quot; which would 
    be for practitioners of all arts, requiring esthetic self-definition through 
    the writing of manifestoes, program notes, autobiographical summaries, proposals, 
    etc. Readings will include appropriate writings of artists who have written 
    about their own work with especial perspicacity, such as John Cage, L. Moholy-Nagy, 
    Ad Reinhardt, Paul Klee, Henry James and Merce Cunningham, with further selections 
    designed to suit the individual ambitions of each student.</p>
  <p> These are meant to supplement (rather than compete with) courses already 
    given; no other university known to me has them (and nobody else could give 
    them). None of them need a detailed syllabus; all of them require a large 
    amount of individual work. ~(1988)~</p>

  <p>~CAMERA-READY COPY FOR A BOOK ABOUT THE GREAT JEWISH CEMETERY OF BERLIN~</p>
  <p>The designs of gravestones, if read closely, can be seen as reflective of 
    changes in collective self-perception and society. The graveyard I chose is 
    the great Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Weissensee, founded in 1880, with over 
    110,000 memorials. In 1984, a West Berlin colleague and I produced a film, 
    ~Ein Verlorenes Berlin~, that regards this cemetery today as the principal 
    surviving evocation of the city's greatest years (1860-1940), and its sound 
    track has since been wholly recomposed with authentic testimony in English, 
    French, Swedish, Spanish and Hebrew. In this public place, which I take to 
    be an exemplary modern urban folk artifact, the visual-verbal designs of the 
    grand mausoleums from the late nineteenth century reveal group attitudes about 
    Berlin and Germany that differ from those reflected in the more circumspect 
    stones with modern typography of the 1920s, while the visual-verbal demeanor 
    of post-WWII memorials reveals other attitudes. What I propose now is producing 
    a book-length camera-ready dummy of photographs and texts; for while the film 
    is good and true in regarding the cemetery as representing a lost city, it 
    also suffers from that medium's limitations in presenting information and 
    interpretation. Whereas R. Etlin's pioneering book about eighteenth-century 
    Parisian graveyards, ~The Architecture of Death~ (1984, with support from 
    NEA-Design) focuses upon cemetery floor plans, my emphasis will be on gravestones. 
    My assumption is that once this dummy is available, my essay in design communication 
    could be easily published (and printed) and thus advance understanding of 
    gravestone/cemetery visages, not only abroad but here in the U.S., perhaps 
    influencing future gravestone articulations.</p>
  <p> Your program staff has not only a photocopy of my general introduction to 
    the cemetery, as published in the ~New York Times~, but a videotape copy of 
    the English version of our award-winning film, ~A Berlin Lost~ (1984), which 
    has already been screened in such major international festivals as Berlin, 
    Edinburgh, Melbourne, Oberhausen and should be viewed as a film introduction 
    to my subject (as the film is less about design as such than the artifact 
    as a surviving visual-verbal representation of a past society). May I advise 
    panelists, in viewing the film, to regard closely such specific design details 
    as the changes in gravestone architecture from turn-of-the-century mausoleums 
    to more modest stones and in typography from Teutonic gothic to international 
    sans serif, and then similarly chronological developments not only in the 
    choice of visual symbols and stones but in characteristic inscriptions (and 
    surrounding vegetation, some of it by now unintentional), as well as such 
    significances as the high German character of the WWI cemetery and the use 
    of Hebrew in place of German; for these issues will be more closely examined 
    in my proposed book. One design detail better done with photographs than film 
    would portray stones whose two sides have different languages, with German 
    on the face and Hebrew on the back, and then sometimes different names as 
    well--for instance, &quot;Adolf&quot; on the German face, and &quot;Abraham&quot; 
    on the Hebrew backside. (Also notice in one shot a pathway whose tall trees 
    implicitly indicate that this cemetery escaped the WWII bombardment that devastated 
    so much else in Berlin.)</p>
  <p> Two more facts that must be made clear is that Weissensee was a cemetery 
    for the ~whole~ Jewish community, unlike here (and elsewhere) where most cemeteries 
    customarily belong only to a particular congregation; and that because this 
    communal graveyard, founded in 1880, now has over 110,000 graves, it represents 
    a whole city of Jewish life with an historical coherence and cultural generality 
    that is epistemologically distinctive, if not distinguished. That accounts 
    for why the biologist Gunther Stent at the end of the film compares Weissensee 
    with Ankor Wat: &quot;a kind of funerary city. . . . It's giving the impression 
    that I was visiting the site of some lost civilization that had existed in 
    some distant past, and that by looking at all these things probably that would 
    be the way to reconstruct the civilization that is no more.&quot;</p>
  <p> In the proposed book, I expect to emphasize and interpret these details 
    of design, in addition to drawing upon my own black-and-white photographs 
    and color transparencies. Following Richard A. Etling's lead, I will also 
    look for Weissensee's original floor plans, for I want to examine all dimensions 
    of design within this single major cemetery. Satisfactory though the film 
    is as an introduction, ~the design subject of the funerary representation 
    of a city demands a book~. To facilitate further research and photography 
    in Berlin, I have applied for a two-month renewal (which I understand to be 
    automatic) of my earlier twelve-month stipend from the DAAD Berliner Kunstlerprogramm, 
    which will also subsidize round-trip transportation there. Thus, the funds 
    requested with this application are wholly for an American citizen working 
    here in English. For this work, as well as the film before it, I have the 
    cooperation of the Jewish community of East Berlin, which controls Weissensee.</p>
  <p> Two other scholarly models to consider are Allen I. Ludwig's book about 
    Puritan iconography, ~Graven Images~ (1966) and Dickran and Ann Tashjian's 
    book about the art of early New England stone carving, ~Memorials for Children 
    of Change~ (1971). Otherwise, since the critical literature on gravestone 
    design is scarcely abundant, there is good reason to believe my book will 
    be considered pioneering. Among its readers I initially see those seriously 
    interested in three subjects: Berlin, Jewish culture of Central Europe and 
    the evolution of design in modern urban graveyards. Beyond them will be those 
    interested in graveyards elsewhere and in the culture of great cities. Among 
    its subsidiary benefits might be greater future attention to issues and possibilities 
    in the truly neglected area of gravestone design (which is rarely distinguished 
    nowadays). In my own mind, let me add, the film especially, and the cemetery 
    implicitly, is about a place that was once like my hometown, New York City, 
    which is to say that both the cemetery, along with representations of its 
    designs, reflect the makings of a great metropolis. ~(1988)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>PUBLIC PRESENTATIONS</p>
  <p>May I tell you about several presentations that I am doing nowadays:</p>
  <p>l. A provocative, illuminating lecture on &quot;Literary Granting in America,&quot; 
    focusing not upon the achievements that are familiar to us all, but upon such 
    recurring problems as jury rigging, class exclusions, rule breaking, unfair 
    competitions, etc. Aiming initially to demystify, I typically compare in detail 
    the history and procedures of one agency, such as the National Endowment for 
    the Arts, with another, such as the New York State Council in the Arts (which 
    is especially scandal-ridden). After the talk I will gladly answer questions 
    and listen to stories, at least to place individual incidents in larger contexts, 
    perhaps to advise. This lecture draws upon articles published in various places 
    over the past few years and upon a forthcoming book, &quot;The Grants Fix.&quot;<br />
    2. &quot;John Cage and Moholy-Nagy as Polyartists,&quot; with slides and audiotape. 
    As the descriptive title implies, this will demonstrate how works in various 
    arts reflect common esthetic principles particular to each major figure.<br />
    3. &quot;Home Movies Reconsidered: An Experiment in Autobiography,&quot; a 
    live performance with silent VHS audiotape in which I comment critically on 
    family home movies and upon larger issues of autohistoriography.<br />
    4. &quot;Innovative Literature in America Today,&quot; likewise with slides 
    and audiotape, focusing not only upon visual and aural literature but upon 
    radical departures in language style and literary structure.<br />
    5. &quot;Writing Extended,&quot; also with slides and audiotape, but in this 
    case a comprehensive survey of my own work in poetry, fiction, audiotape, 
    videotape, photography, holography, and film.<br />
    6. &quot;Audio Writing,&quot; an introduction to my own work just with audiotape, 
    with many short examples and live commentary. Longer works of my audio art 
    available for concerts include ~Invocations~ (in twenty languages, for sixty 
    minutes); ~The Gospels~ (in English, one hundred minutes, or in German as 
    ~Die Evangelien~, 60 minutes); ~New York City~, which comes in three lengths--one 
    60 minutes international version, the second a 140 minutes American version, 
    and the third an 87 minutes first draft, all composed of sounds particular 
    to my hometown, which can be played in conjunction with an elaborate slide 
    presentation involving hundreds of comparable New York City images. These 
    works are particularly effective in sequence and in daytime venues. During 
    visits, I can introduce each of these tapes and answer questions about them.<br />
    7. &quot;Video Writing,&quot; in which I present my video compositions, mostly 
    based upon texts of mine, that exploit such capabilities unique to video as 
    the charcter-<br />
    generator.<br />
    8. &quot;The Radio Art of Glenn Gould,&quot; my introduction, with audiotape, 
    to the remarkably unknown &quot;docudramas&quot; produced by the great Canadian 
    musician.<br />
    9. ~A Berlin Lost/Ein Verlorenes Berlin/Berlin Perdu/Ett Forlorat Berlin~, 
    our four twenty-one-minute films with different sound tracks (respectively 
    in English, German, French, Swedish) of authentic testimony about the Great 
    Jewish cemetery of Berlin as the principal surviving relic of prewar Berlin 
    and its greatest years. These are best shown in sequence, as the imagery begs 
    to be reseen. I can provide printed English translations for the last three, 
    as well as a Spanish translation of the German only, and when I show the films 
    myself, answer questions about the cemetery and these stylistically unusual 
    documentaries. The films themselves are available for screening without me; 
    videotape copies also exist in 3/4 inch and 1/2 inch VHS formats.<br />
    10. &quot;Epiphanies,&quot; which is the collective title for a multimedia 
    work of single-sentence stories whose text is available for an exhibition 
    or theatrical presentation and on a film, a videotape, an audiotape, parts 
    or all of which can be used in either a single presentation, a series or an 
    installation.<br />
    11. &quot;Numbers: Poems &amp; Stories&quot;: My most popular show, with slides 
    and commentary, of my art composed entirely of numerals--given in over fifty 
    places over the past decade.<br />
    12. &quot;Visual Poetry &amp; Visual Fiction&quot;: Another traditional slide 
    show, with voice-over narration, of my own early exploratory work--likewise 
    given over fifty times.<br />
    13. &quot;Gertrude Stein as the Great American Person of Avant-Garde Letters&quot;: 
    The only utterly straight lecture, with neither slides nor tapes, that I can 
    be persuaded to give.</p>
  <p> I am in general willing to visit classes, particularly if I can discuss 
    works I have done or am doing. For all concerned, a series of presentations, 
    stretching over a few consecutive days, is worth more than just a single shot. 
    My fees can be characterized as midrange and, of course, become less per day 
    for extended stays; but bear in mind that just as some artist/writers teach 
    so that they can do other things for nothing, the firmest base of my sporadic 
    income, as well as exhaustive charity, is touring. Past sponsors of over two 
    hundred presentations have included art museums, alternative spaces, cultural 
    centers and university departments of literature, art, music, speech, media, 
    intermedia, American studies and combinations of them, as well as student 
    organizations. ~(1988)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~A BOOK ON &quot;THE AVANT-GARDE IN THE 1980s&quot;~</p>
  <p>The book would have three sections: the first reprinting essays about others, 
    the second theoretical statements, and the third considerations of my own 
    work. In the first section would be my essays on John Cage as a Radio Artist 
    (from ~Iowa Review~), the interview with John Cage about his ~Finnegans Wake~ 
    writings (from ~Tri-Quarterly~), Glenn Gould as a Radio Artist (from ~Boulevard~), 
    the profile of the sculptor George Rhoads (~Smithsonian~), Merce Cunningham-John 
    Cage (from the Brooklyn Academy catalogue for Fall 1986), the profile of Kenneth 
    Burke (from ~New York Times Book Review~), Don Celender (a major book artist, 
    from ~New York Arts Journal~), the Special Sound of German Radio (~New York 
    Times~), &quot;Literary Videotapes&quot; (forthcoming in ~American Book Review~), 
    &quot;The Literature of SoHo&quot; (from ~Shantih~), &quot;Avant-Grade Poetry 
    Now&quot; (from ~American Book Review~), &quot;John Martin&quot; (the publisher, 
    from the ~Times Book Review~), &quot;The Opiate of the Intellectuals&quot; 
    (about the appreciation of sports, from ~Artworkers News~), among others. 
    The second section would have &quot;The Artistic Explosion&quot; from Wallechensky's 
    ~The Book of Predictions~ and three manifestos--&quot;Literary Video,&quot; 
    &quot;Why Audio Drama Now,&quot; &quot;Book Art&quot; (all widely reprinted, 
    but here in their definitive forms), etc. Section three would have &quot;Texts 
    &amp; Proposals for Radio,&quot; &quot;Literary Holography,&quot; &quot;Keeping 
    Afloat in New York,&quot; and perhaps my retrospective on anthologies (from 
    ~Contact II~). I can paste up a sample, should anyone like to see it; and 
    I can also promise to rewrite from scratch, delivering the manuscript on discs 
    to facilitate accurate and cheaper typesetting, if a publisher prefers. This 
    book should attract everyone interested in the more advanced developments 
    in contemporary arts, initially literature, but also including intermedia. 
    None of them has appeared in any previous books of mine published here. There 
    should be an introduction, a wholly fresh essay, about the 1980s as different 
    from the 1970s and 1960s. ~(1988)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>~AN ANTHOLOGY OF &quot;HIGH-TECH POETRY&quot;~</p>
  <p>Eduardo Kac, my colleague in Holopoetry, as he calls it, writes from Brazil 
    that he would like us to do together an international anthology of &quot;High-Tech 
    Poetry,&quot; which is to say a book of and about poetry made through (and 
    ~not~ about) technologies made available within the past quarter century (video, 
    holography, computer; but ~not~ audiotape). This book could include photos, 
    descriptive texts and anything else that can be printed, in addition to, short 
    of media examples, addresses where discs or videotapes or whatever can be 
    obtained. It could also include theoretical essays and manifestos. The bias 
    is toward poetry discovering what can be written directly for these media, 
    realizing their unique capabilities, rather than simply reproducing what was 
    originally on the page. The plan is to publish the polylingual book in both 
    Brazil and the U.S., printing there (which is much cheaper), so that an English-language 
    publisher wishing to collaborate with a Brazilian should contact me. Writers 
    wishing to submit appropriate English-language material of any kind should 
    send it directly to me; in other languages to Eduardo Kac. Then please be 
    patient; not unlike other unprecedented things, this may well take a while 
    to happen. ~(1988)~</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p> His life is the life of the artist, one disappointment after another.--Olive 
    Cowell on her son Henry, quoted in Nicolas Slonimsky, ~Perfect Pitch~ (1988)</p>
  <p>~THE COMPLETION OF &quot;A SPECIAL TIME,&quot; AN AUDIO COMPOSITION ABOUT 
    THE 1960s~</p>
  <p>When a novelist friend, a few years ago, challenged me to write a novel, 
    I thought first of the 1960s, not as a chronological period but as a cultural 
    concept, and of writing a panoramic novel, roughly in the manner of Dos Passos, 
    about the experiences of a variety of people at that time. However, once I 
    made notes about narratives to include in my novel, I began to hear voices 
    telling particular stories; and since I have recently been producing so much 
    radio, I decided it would be best for me to work initially with authentic 
    voices.</p>
  <p> My initial themes were two: the 1960s was a special time as other decades 
    were not, and then that it was special in more ways than we commonly remember 
    or understand. While I did not want to neglect the political protest commonly 
    associated with the period, my principal interest was episodes of &quot;anonymous 
    history,&quot; to use Sigfried Giedion's phrase--dimensions of experience 
    that are now invisible or forgotten, even though, in this case, they occurred 
    only two decades ago. So in selecting participants to interview, I looked 
    first of all for individuals who had either personal experience or expert 
    knowledge of some specialness in this period. Thus, I have a pharmacology 
    professor talk about the last age of drug optimism, during which, in his most 
    prominent example, Valium sales peaked at seventy-five million prescriptions, 
    only to become by now half of what they were; a math professor to remember 
    the rise and fall of the &quot;new math&quot;; the manager of an investment 
    fund to talk about the stock market boom of the middle sixties and then about 
    how, because of values predominant in the period, he felt more comfortable 
    not displaying his wealth, again unlike now; a fashion writer to talk about 
    the radical changes in female dress and the current persistence of these changes. 
    And so on.</p>
  <p> In selecting interviewees, I also looked for another quality--voices so 
    distinctive that they need not be reintroduced. This was necessary because 
    I wanted not to make a conventional radio feature, with an announcer (probably 
    a celebrity) identifying speakers and making connections, but an informal 
    symposium in which the remarks of various individuals would be interwoven 
    as though they were participating in a continuous conversation. My assumptions 
    were that the speakers would establish their authority not through an announcer's 
    identification of their current positions (or even their names) but through 
    the authenticity of their articulated memories and perceptions, and then that 
    this authority could be extended, in a listener's mind, to their subsequent 
    appearances on the tape. I also wanted to let sophisticated listeners, like 
    those of public radio stations here, make their own connections from the testimonies.</p>
  <p> For the pilot of &quot;A Special Time,&quot; I personally conducted over 
    three dozen interviews, initially with old friends, and then with new friends, 
    such acquaintance accounting for why the speakers sound as though they are 
    talking to someone familiar. These interviews were necessarily transcribed, 
    because one disadvantage in editing audiotape, unlike film, is that there 
    is nothing to see. Since words seen are easier to organize than words heard, 
    the tapes had to be transcribed. Studying these transcriptions, I decided 
    which passages to excerpt for the opening sixty-minute feature and then in 
    which order those excerpts should go. My aim was to compose an associational 
    flow, as though each new participant were extending what had previously been 
    said, and then to introduce many of the topics that would be developed in 
    individual hour-long programs later in the series. Many speakers were edited 
    to sound clearer, more fluent and more interesting than they actually were; 
    so that this testimonial from an early listener is partially an implicit tribute 
    to our artifice: &quot;There are a lot of people on this tape I wish I knew.&quot; 
  </p>
  <p> Once in a private eight-track studio, I decided to distribute these participants 
    over the stereo spectrum; and since six separate tracks were available to 
    me for speech, there were, so to speak, six seats from which they would speak: 
    on a metaphorical clock at 9:30, 10:30, 11:30, 12:30, 1:30, and 2:30. In the 
    remaining two tracks of multitrack tape, I placed music and historic sounds 
    mostly from the period as a kind of counterpoint that could be acoustic or 
    thematic or both. Most of these background sounds extend over at least two 
    monologues, bridging the natural pauses between successive speakers. Since 
    moments when music and speech pause together were rare, we had to mix in live 
    time the eight tracks of sound down to the more accessible two tracks of a 
    stereotape. All in all, we worked over thirty hours in this multitrack studio 
    simply to produce the rough draft of an illusion of a fluent hour-long conversation 
    accompanied by appropriate background sounds.</p>
  <p> Though I already have enough testimony on tape to compose several more hour-<br />
    long conversations on individual topics such as politics, manners, values, 
    enterprise, culture, learning-research and the Vietnam War, I expect to do 
    yet more interviews, mainly during my tours as a visiting artist/lecturer, 
    hopefully discovering yet more &quot;hidden history.&quot; The plan is initially 
    to remix the pilot, eliminating imperfections, and then produce either a dozen 
    more hour-long programs or a single program several hours long (ideally for 
    a special comparable to say, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the JFK assassination 
    and then for release on a single hi-fi videocassette). One element I enjoy 
    about this project is its reawakening my training in American history (M.A., 
    Columbia University) and earlier curiosity about innovative historiography, 
    now all at the service of my more recent interests in the artful organization 
    of speech and sound.</p>
  <p> Need I say there is evidence all around us of continuing interest in the 
    60s as the most significant of recent decades, as reflected in many areas 
    of our culture: movies, popular music, fiction, clothing, and political debate. 
    The critical and popular success of the &quot;Vietnam&quot; series on public 
    television illustrates the continuing appetite for analysis and recall of 
    this period in American life. Nonetheless, there have been no comprehensive 
    oral histories of the decade since Walter Cronkite's contemporaneous updating 
    of Edward R. Murrow's decade-by-decade ~Hear It Now~, a three-record set (CBS) 
    of narrated news clips that by contemporary standards seems stylistically 
    primitive. That is the vacuum that &quot;A Special Time&quot; aims to fill.
