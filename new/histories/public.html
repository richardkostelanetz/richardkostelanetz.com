  <p>The writer/artist RICHARD KOSTELANETZ, born in New York City in 1940, attended 
    Brown, Columbia, and the University of London on Woodrow Wilson, New York 
    State Regents, and Fulbright fellowships, taking his M.A. in American intellectual 
    history. He subsequently received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, 
    The Fund for Investigative Journalism, Pulitzer Foundation, the American Public 
    Radio Program Fund, and the DAAD Berliner Kunstlerprogramm, in addition to 
    several grants from the visual arts and media arts programs of the National 
    Endowment for the Arts. For semesters he has been a Visiting Professor of 
    American Studies and English at the University of Texas and a Visiting Professor 
    of graduate theater at Hunter College, CUNY. He has lectured and presented 
    his work at scores of institutions around the world. For his entire adult 
    life he has lived in his home town, currently in the Rockaways after nearly 
    three decades in SoHo, surrounded by thousands of books, hundreds of videotapes, 
    thirty feet of long-playing records, scores of cassettes, several audio and 
    video machines, and his own artwork.</p>
  <p>Since beginning to publish in national magazines in 1961, he has contributed 
    poems, stories, articles, reviews, and experimental prose to hundreds of magazines 
    both here and abroad. He has written more than fifty books of criticism, cultural 
    history, and creative work, in addition to editing over three dozen anthologies 
    of art and exposition. Among the recent books authored by him are <em>SoHo: 
    The Rise and Fall of an Artistâ€™s Colony</em> (Routledge), <em>3 Canadian Geniuses</em> 
    (Colombo), <em>More Wordworks</em> (Talisman), and second editions of <em>A 
    Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes</em> (Schirmer/Routledge) and <em>Conversing 
    with Cage</em> (Routledge). New books edited by him include <em>AnOther E. 
    E. Cummings</em> (Liveright), <em>The Gertrude Stein Reader</em> (Cooper Square) 
    and <em>Virgil Thomson: A Reader</em> (Routledge). Long active in alternative 
    literary publishing, he co-founded Assembling Press in 1970 and alone founded 
    Future Press in 1977 and Archae Editions in 1978.</p>
  <p>As a media artist Kostelanetz has created language-based audiotapes, videotapes, 
    films, and holograms that have been exhibited and broadcast around the world. 
    Both Anthology Film Archives (New York) and Bumbershoot (Seattle) have presented 
    retrospectives of his audiovideotapes. Wordsand was the title of a multimedia 
    exhibition of art with words, numbers, and lines that toured North American 
    universities in 1978-81. International Artists Books (Paris) mounted a retrospective 
    of his book art in 1996. Among the arts institutions granting him production 
    residencies are the Electronic Music Studio of Stockholm, the Experimental 
    TV Center in Owego, New York, the Dennis Gabor Laboratory of the Museum of 
    Holography, the Brooklyn College Center for Computer Music, the Public Access 
    Synthesizer Studio in New York, and the public radio stations WXXI-FM and 
    WGBH-FM in Rochester and Boston respectively.</p>
  <p> Individual entries on his work in several fields appear in various editions 
    of <em>A Readerâ€™s Guide to Twentieth-Century Writers</em> (ed. Peter Parker, 
    Oxford), the <em>Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature, Contemporary 
    Poets, Contemporary Novelists, Postmodern Fiction, Baker's Biographical Dictionary 
    of Musicians, Directory of American Scholars, Who's Who in U.S. Writers, Editors, 
    and Poets, Who's Who in America, Who's Who in the World, Who's Who in American 
    Art, Websterâ€™s Dictionary of American Authors, and Encyclopedia Britannica</em>, 
    among other directories. When the publishers listed in the annual <em>Directory 
    of American Poetry Publishers</em> (Dustbooks) have been asked to name five 
    poets they printed recently, he generally ranks around among the top five, 
    currently third with 20 votes. Nonetheless, he still needs two dollars (US) 
    to get on a New York City subway.<br />
